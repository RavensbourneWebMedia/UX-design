# Project

All your project files **must be pushed to GitHub**, in the *branch* called with your name, inside your *folder*

(for example, branch: `matteo`, folder: `students/matteo`)

- [ ] Pull request instead?

In your folder, include a **README.md** file that introduces your <del>app</del>? and explains how it works. It must 

* be at least 200 words  
* have a couple of images/screenshots (more than two are welcome of course)
* include at least one link to research or inspiration
* include links to all your blog posts 

**MD** stands for `MarkDown` and it's just a text file that GitHub converts to HTML. 

You're reading a MD file right now, and there are plenty of MD files in the GitHub repository for this project, for instance [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204/tree/master/notes).

Here is an [easy guide (3 minutes)](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) on writing MarkDown.

You can use [this free app](http://25.io/mou/) to craft <abbr title="MarkDown">MD</abbr> files on OSX, or [this free one](http://markdownpad.com/) for Windows. Or, even better, you can work on MD online using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io)!




# Blog

Your blog is a **self-assessment** and creative process **documentation tool**. 

We don’t ask you to blog to fill your time. Documenting your project through a blog helps you develop your **critical thinking and analysis skills**. Just writing all positive, unspecific things about a project doesn’t exercise those analytic mind muscles.

Your blog should have at least 12 posts.

Topics from each week:

1. [ ] TODO


You can blog either on [4F](http://www.fourthfloor.me/) or [Medium](https://medium.com). Tumblr is also ok.
