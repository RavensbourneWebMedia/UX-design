A less contrived method could be

1. brainstorm and jot down **players** in the **system** (could be based on your personas), eg: visitor, potential customer, new customer, customer, system admin, developer, content editor
* for each player, jot down **actions** s/he may want to do, eg: read about the service, get contact details, find info about opening times.. 
* for each action think about `before i do that, i need to` chains.. or in a gaming frame `in order to unlock this action/skill, i need to`
* separate actions between **tasks** (intermediate in a chain) and **goals** (end of chain) 
* map actions to players (one action could be assigned to more than one player)
* organise actions that the system must / could / shoudn't allows players to do

We could use Trello for this, amirite? players > lists, actions > cards.. what about chains? what about "duplicate" actions?

# Term 3

http://framerjs.com/learn/import/
http://blog.invisionapp.com/6-ways-to-save-time-in-rapid-prototyping

puzzle pieces: bringing them all together
design vs user experience: discovery and decisions

Each student pick an effect from [CogLode](http://coglode.com), research it and present it to the class. Discuss how effects could be applied to individual projects.



# The future

1. Redesign emails (as a warm-up exercise in UX). Seems like a problem many companies are having a go at ([Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) by Dropbox, [Inbox](http://www.google.com/inbox/) by Google, [Sanebox](http://www.sanebox.com/tour) by Sanebox). One thing that struck me from Sanebox is the self-referentiality of their communication (it's from tech entrepreneurs to tech entrepreneurs): who else receives emails from investors, why is "holidays-mode" associated with drinking mojitos on a beach? Also check out [dotMail](http://www.vanschneider.com/work/dotmailapp), a concept that didn't make it to production, but had a refreshing take on *what is email* and *what can email be*.

2. [The interface layer](https://medium.com/bridge-collection/the-interface-layer-when-design-commoditizes-tech-e7017872173a) micro-brief (one week): pick one website (competitor?), extract its content and re-design its interface. Can be soft re-design (same platform / medium) or hard (different platform / medium.. eg text-to-speech interface on wristband, text-to-image flashcard for deaf?)
