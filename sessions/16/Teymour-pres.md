### History of the tour guides

Linear storytelling experience:

* 1960s tourism sector boomed > audio tour guides started off at that time
* 1980s > walkman used in museums
* Museums start putting up *blockbuster* exhibitions

Non-linear guides:

* *Democratisation* of tech and tools of production
* 90s digital audio guides
* 2014 the British Museum purchased 500 Android devices (£200 each), locked them into their own software and rents them out at £5 a pop

### Challenges

Cultural institutions generally don't have the financial means to maintain tech and content

Museums love their toys (like `kids going to a candy store`)

### Stories

> Tech comes and goes...

Humans have been sharing stories for millennia. The media have changed (oral storytelling, written and linear storytelling, interactive audiovisual storytelling, games) but the neurological reactions are still the same. 

Visitors (well, people in general) love to share great stories.

Museums have the stories, but they're not always good at storytelling.
