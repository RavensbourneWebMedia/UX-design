Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!

<!--
In the morning we’ll have a guest from izi.TRAVEL, who offered to run a workshop with our students for free. Using that platform, students will prototype audio-visual tour guides about the Maritime Museum. Then in the afternoon we’ll come to NMM to test what they produced. You’re welcome to join in and see what they’re doing, if you have time (I’ll text you when we’re on our way). This time we won’t be pestering your visitors ;)


Students should come prepared with some content: an idea for a story / tour.

One story for the indoors and one for the outdoors, then we try to connect them both.

# AM 

## Guest talk

Teymour: brief presentation about the why and how of [izi.TRAVEL](https://izi.travel/en), what is interesting about audio guides, and how to design user experiences for cultural tourists.

## Workshop: content-prototyping 

So far you've been prototyping ideas, while today the focus will be on **content**, rather than interfaces.

We'll be using [izi.TRAVEL](https://izi.travel/en) to produce tour guides, and understand the potential and limitations of prototyping with content.

First you'll create an **outdoor tour** for (North) Greenwich. It can be either a tour centred around Ravensbourne, or a tour about Greenwich.

You will use 4 points of interest, ideally not more than 10 minutes walk from each other (to quickly test them). 

# PM

## Workshop: **indoor tour** at NMM

In class, you'll record audio content and create the guide on [izi.TRAVEL](https://izi.travel/en).

Then we'll go to the Maritime Museum to test it.
