# Week 16

### Today, Thursday 19th May 2016

1. Guest talk: Teymour Sursock from [izi.TRAVEL](https://izi.travel/en) on **UX design for cultural tourists**
* Workshop: **content-prototyping**.

	AM: outdoor tour of North Greenwich
	
	PM: indoor tour of the Maritime Museum

Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!

<!--
In the morning we’ll have a guest from izi.TRAVEL, who offered to run a workshop with our students for free. Using that platform, students will prototype audio-visual tour guides about the Maritime Museum. Then in the afternoon we’ll come to NMM to test what they produced. You’re welcome to join in and see what they’re doing, if you have time (I’ll text you when we’re on our way). This time we won’t be pestering your visitors ;)


Students should come prepared with some content: an idea for a story / tour.

One story for the indoors and one for the outdoors, then we try to connect them both.

# AM 

## Guest talk

Teymour: brief presentation about the why and how of [izi.TRAVEL](https://izi.travel/en), what is interesting about audio guides, and how to design user experiences for cultural tourists.

## Workshop: content-prototyping 

So far you've been prototyping ideas, while today the focus will be on **content**, rather than interfaces.

We'll be using [izi.TRAVEL](https://izi.travel/en) to produce tour guides, and understand the potential and limitations of prototyping with content.

First you'll create an **outdoor tour** for (North) Greenwich. It can be either a tour centred around Ravensbourne, or a tour about Greenwich.

You will use 4 points of interest, ideally not more than 10 minutes walk from each other (to quickly test them). 


# PM

## Workshop: **indoor tour** at NMM

In class, you'll record audio content and create the guide on [izi.TRAVEL](https://izi.travel/en).

Then we'll go to the Maritime Museum to test it.


# Homework

Continue prototyping your idea

### Blog

**Evaluate** izi.TRAVEL, both front-end (the app) and back-end (the CMS).

The questions below can guide your evaluation. Feel free to reflect on and write about other aspects of izi.TRAVEL, which are not covered by the questions below.

Front-end:

* How do you find the **onboarding process**? How does the app *welcome* you as a new user and show you what you can do with it?
* How is the **language** of the app's interface? What do the buttons say? 
* How is **content** presented? Compare a couple of tour guides, possibly from two different museums / institutions, and think about which one presents its collection in the most suitable way
* What **features** could be improved, and why?
* What features could be **added**, and why?

Back-end:
 
* How does the CMS teach you how to use it? How is the **learning curve**?
* What happens if you make a **mistake**?
* What **features** could be improved, and why?
* What features could be **added**, and why?
