# Week 16

Students should come prepared with some content: an idea for a story / tour.

One story for the indoors and one for the outdoors, then we try to connect them both.

See previous week's [homework](../15#homework)

### AM 

Teymour: brief presentation about the why and how of izi.travel, what is interesting about audio guides, how the platform benefits the cultural tourism sector.

Workshop: first we'll create an **outdoor tour** for (North) Greenwich. It can be either a tour centred around Ravensbourne, or a tour about Greenwich.

Students will use 4 points of interest, ideally not more than 10 minutes walk from each other (to quickly test them). 

### PM

Workshop: **indoor tour** for NMM.

In class, we'll record audio content and create the guide on izi.travel.

Then we'll go to the museum to test it. The museum has free WiFi. 

[ ] Matteo to give Chris @NMM a heads-up that we're coming!
