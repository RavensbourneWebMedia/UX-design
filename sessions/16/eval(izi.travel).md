#### Front-end

> How do you find the on boarding process? How does the app welcome you as a new user and show you what you can do with it?

I found the boarding process very easy and helpful. As a new user I felt that the tutorials available were useful but there were still a few segments that I was hazy with. After consulting another member of the class however it was all very clear.

> How is the language of the app’s interface? What do the buttons say?

The usage of language and what the buttons have written on them (e.g. create) is very accessible and easy to understand. However since the website is very different to many other popular sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, Youtube) some users may initially struggle to come to terms with it.

> How is content presented?

The content is presented in a highly digestible and smart manner. After observing a few different tours I noticed similarities between them however the general style and flow varied from museum to museum. After comparing an art museum and a nature tour the difference between them were highly impressive and they were both very immersive. One fantastic feature was having the ability to see the tours, you and other people have created, on your mobile phone without doing any difficult programming.

> What features could be improved, and why?

The audio section could be made easier by having a built in option to record straight to the browser since you currently have to record and edit the audio with your own applications such as Audacity.

> What features could be added, and why?

It would be nice to have a selection of transition animations between tour segments/slides. This would allow for greater customisation

#### Back-end

> How does the CMS teach you how to use it? How is the learning curve?

It is rather difficult initially but after having made parts of your first tour it is extremely easy and opens up a whole world of possibilities. The learning curve it steep initially but after the first half an hour or so it becomes very easy to use.

> What happens if you make a mistake?

If you make a mistake you can simply go back and edit it or delete the segment completely if you want to.

> What features could be improved, and why?

It would be useful if when you choose to add a language it could automatically translate the content that you already have, via the use of an online translator such as google translate.

> What features could be added, and why?

It would be good to have the ability to use extended code to change the stylesheets of the pages completely. This would allow for an almost infinite amount of variety for the tours.

The first process that I'm going to be reviewing in the Front-end section of the Izi travel app:

Well, firstly the onboarding process was really difficult I and also my group didn't understand what it is or what we were doing. I think the reason for this is because there isn't really any hints or guides telling you that this app is used for tours. What we started gathering was that it some sort of travel app that might lead you around the city.

When opening the app it doesn't welcome users affectively because once it was opened I was now just in this giant app of things clicking on images. I feel like it has the opportunity to welcome the users and state what its about.

In concerns of the language used in the app it did its job and was very suitable, it used very Informal and Standard writing style which would be useful for those who are foreign which a lot would be as its a tour app it also just fits with the posts nicely.

The platform design is very modern and sleek which I do like and doesn't take away from the idea of it being a tour app but on the other hand confusion appeared again with there being two completely different tours one being very professional and the other some kind of pub crawl / search throwing me and my group members off slightly. To improve this I would suggest categories on opening the app.

When enter a tour I found the content was very good consisting of loads of information, some text then Audio guides along side a picture, which help emerge me into the experience or tour.

In terms of content I first through there was more content on the museum tours as it all there after the first click but after more bit more use with the app I learned to understand that comparing the walking tour they have similar amounts of content both, having a good amount of text, a few images and narration. Overall I find the museum tour more enjoyable as I cant preview what ill be doing earlier.

I couldn't really suggest beside some kind of categories but I will say having a profile of some sort seem to make it more user friendly I'm my option.

Now to the back Back-end of Izi travel where you would be creating and managing the tours:

Similar to the app the learning curve is quite steep as it just throws you into a page with a lot of option which confused me because it didn't know what I could achieve in this CMS but on the other hand the help section was quite helpful showing images and what to do in each section. A suggestion would be to have video tutorials as if we didn't have a one of the staff member come and guide us through the steps I'm sure it would found it more difficult.

With it being difficult to understand we made a few mistakes and had to delete things which I'm not sure is the only way but thats all that we could see from the test and with it saying “ delete exhibition” it seemed like for one mistake you pay a large price due to the working mainly.

I would suggestion steps through the processes and once a few step are completed maybe using the content that is there now.

On another note the design didn't match exactly to the app which I think it should e.g. sharp and full layout to rounded and spacious layout.

#### Front-end

When you first open the app it will offer tours that are close to your location. Having opened the app in Greenwich, it offered many tours round our location being London, and they varied immensely. Throughout the app, much of the language used was kept clear and simple for users to understand. During the tours, it tracks your location. Meaning that during audio guided tours for example, when you hit the checkpoints that have been placed by the creators of the tours the relevant audio will begin to play. izi.TRAVEL have really thought about how tours are conducted and that many tours may venture beyond the walls of a museum, and so they allow creators to create tours which incorporate both inside and outside tours. A combination of tours would be a fun way of developing this app, allowing many tour/guide creators to collaborate ideas with each other, offering a more in-depth tour/guide for users.

#### Back-end

I found that the CMS is quite peculiar. Being an avid user of WordPress, I found that the CMS for izi.TRAVEL is very strange and a bit clunky. It seems confusing that you have to create a tour or a guide to change some of the aspects of the dashboard. I’d say that improving the CMS would be to offer a UI walkthrough as you sign in as a first time user which allows the user to uizi.TRAVELnderstand the main features of the CMS straight away.

### Sanj

From user testing and Evaluating the izi.TRAVEL, both front-end (the app) and back-end (the CMS) was an interesting platform to use or to trial out, you could do a few interesting things such as create tours or collections and post it to the app. You could also have a custom map with pointers which would calculate the difference for you, so you could set point one outside Ravensbourne then point two the Maritime Museum and it would calculate the time and how long it will take you for you to take a tour. For example you could set it from Greenwich Maritime museum to the Cutty Sark and have pointers so you follow that route. For those of you who do not know what it is, izi.TRAVEL is an app that is a sightseeing museum and landmark audio tour guide.

#### Front-end

The on boarding process is very interesting and welcoming. It shows and explains what you can do. It is very engaging as the on board experience states “explore the world with your personal audio guide”. The app also states what it will be doing for example it says “the app will keep you informed about the tour progress”.

The language of the apps interface is well designed and language that is mainly used is images rather than text based, most actions (buttons) you want to click on are actually either icons or small visuals. There is a little globe on the top left which if you click on you go to maps and another clever thing the app has produced is that on the top right it has a funnel looking icon which actually if you click on filters stuff out or changes the app according to your preferences such as filter by rating or filter by category and preferred languages.

The content is presented in a neat format for example if you go on to any tour guide it is clearly mapped out and what the tour is and what type of tour it is in regards to travelling, one of them is a walking tour. You can either click “start” to start the tour or you can click an interesting button which says “sights”, this page comes with a video track and images of the collections you are viewing. Also it gives a short description of the tour before you click start. There is also a reviews page listed so you can see how popular the tour is or whether it is worth taking or viewing the tour.

#### Back-end

The CMS teaches me how it works for you in a video and audio format which is creative and engaging for the user. Once you sign up and login to the CMS page it gives you a variety of options to click on for example under the help page it gives you many options you can click on for help in case you cannot do something yourself the help page will tell you how to go about it or what you can do or if there is any restrictions.  This is a learning curve for me as I have never used this app or backend side of this app, it is a learning curve as I’ve learnt and picked up on when testing or creating a guide/tour on the back end.

### Kieran

#### Front-end

Starting the app you can see lots of different tours that will take you round the places that are currently close to you. For example, when i first opened the app i saw a Jack The Ripper tour around London.

The language used on the app is very simple with the majority of the time not needing any buttons at all and instead having an audio guide that tracks your location. When you come close to one of the locations, the next piece of audio will start playing.

The tours can be inside and outside so when you are thinking of a museum in a historic location then the guide wouldn't just be about inside the museum but may also take you elsewhere and outside.

The features that i would improve would be to make the tours provide more content on them or the ability to combine tours that are near by. This way you could learn more than one thing but also be in the same place. So the ability to learn whats around you as well as the ability to learn about one specific topic.

#### Back-end

The CMS can be difficult to learn but with a help page thats separate to the building of the Tour, it can help with the building but i find it a little annoying that its on a different page. This could be a feature to improve on the site as it would help you to design your own tourist guide.

A feature that could be added would be a way of identifying when you are struggling when creating a tour and for it to help you out.

### Ade

I was quite impressed when opening The Travel app for the first time. You are welcomed by a short instruction of how to use the app, the instruction was easy to understand plus and short, which I found very useful. The language used for the instruction was very basic and easy to understand. 
After that you go through to the main page of the app which is well designed and layout well.
Although the icons are not named so you would have to guess what they do, which I found quite annoying.
The content available is well presented with clear images that support the content. There was good description about each tour, and very easy to scroll up and down to view.

But what I find lacking about this app is there is enough content to support the app, not enough tours and the tours to me I found and not very interesting. 

### Ryder

In todays lecture we had an introduction to izi.TRAVEL when I was introduced to the concept I found the idea to be very interesting, as I had not seen anything like it before. I found the app to be very intriguing and the first thing I did was look at the places around the word izi.TRAVEL was being used. when I set up an account, personally I didn’t really know where to start as I felt there wasn’t enough information when setting up to get you started. Luckily enough Teymour gave the class a step by step guide on how to set up tours which I feel if I was doing the process on my own I would find it rather difficult. Once I had an understanding of the back end I created a test walking tour around Greenwich, when the day went on me and Aidan sat together and created a prototype version of the Thames experience walk with the izi.TRAVEL tour creator.

#### Things I would improve on.

* When searching for Locations sometimes they would be in accurate.
* When you land on a location it changes from google maps data to a different database once selected.

### Ollie

The design is simple and flat, with a striking logo that stands out It looks as if the loading screen is meant to look like a map, however the contrast between the colours of the road and the built up area is not obvious, however it serves no purpose so this is not necessarily important or an issue.
Upon loading, there is a page asking the user to allow the app to use certain functions on the phone, such as location and sending notifications. The app is not intrusive and will not require you to enable these functions each time you use the app.

The app then takes you to a screen that will take you to a page to explore the guides, the image used is of the eiffel tower, this screen use geolocation to show an image relevant to the area you are in. For example, the easyJet app uses an image of the city you are flying to, whilst this is not based on your location, it adds some context to the page. To some users, this could suggest that it will show you guides in Paris. Other than that, it is simple and there is only ‘one way to go’ once the app has been set up.

‘Editor’s choice’ is the first page that is shown to the user when the app is fully set up. I am sure this changes every so often, however the information shown is likely to be irrelevant to what the user is after, perhaps the editors choice could show guides that are either the editors choice in the area you are in, or just show a list of guides that are in the immediate area.

The buttons at the bottom of the screen are clear, however I do not see the harm in adding labels to make it clearer as to what each button does.

The first button, which resembles a compass I assume shows you tours nearest to you. This is good if you are in an area where there are tours available, however I am located in an area where there are no tours, and the nearest tours to me are 30+ miles away. Perhaps the tours could be sorted into cities instead of based just on your location, this could even encourage people to want to travel to other places that they have seen on the app. As there are no tours for me to enjoy in the area surrounding me, this part of the app is boring and does not serve any purpose.

If you take a look at AirBnB, there are a number of city Guidebooks, these are all assorted into cities and show a number of different places you can go and see. For someone like me, who has no tours around me to be able to go and visit, it could encourage me to want to go and visit a certain place.

The editor’s choice section does, to some extent encourage you to visit the featured locations, however this section serves a different purpose and showcases some of the best locations as chosen by the editors.

Each tour comes with a striking image and minimal text, just the title of the tour. Perhaps the city/country could be included as well. It is obvious, to me, that you need to click on the image to take you to see more information about the tour.

Once you have clicked on the tour you would like to go on, it shows you some information about the tour you have clicked on. I do not like the fact that it does not show you the full amount of text, I think it show the whole description, otherwise there are too many levels and I think this just makes the app too ‘deep’. I do like the fact that you can like the tour using Facebook, however you could have an internal like system, this could then rank certain tours and allow users to see the most and least ‘liked’ tours.

The user profile button seems unnecessary and as far as I’m aware, it only allows you to change settings and look at things you have purchased and the tours you have been on. I would remove this section and combine it with the settings button.

The QR reader button is confusing, there is no examples of where I could use this feature if I was on a tour. Perhaps they could list museums where this feature works, or explain how it works and what it does.
