# Session 3	

### Today, Thursday 15th January 2015

1. Play-acting social networks (from previous session)
* Qualitative and quantitative user research
* Interviewing users (write and test a script)	



# User research

### Why do we need to do research?

Discuss:

* *Assumptions* vs *evidence*
* [*Mental models*](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models)
* *Usability* vs *usefulness*
* **Who** are we designing for?

## What is UX research?

It boils down to spending (a lot of) time talking to people (aka *the users*) to find out:

* *What* are they currently doing?
* *How* are they doing something?
* What *problems* and *challenges* do they face?
* What do they *want*?
* What do they *think* they want?
* What do *we* think they want?

We use user research **insight** to inform design and improve development.

### Is user-testing UX research?

Yes, it's part of it.

## When should we do UX research?

**At any stage** of a project.

Depending on how far in the project we are, some methods are more appropriate than others.

A simplified table:

Stage					| Methods			
-----------------------	| -------
Idea					| Interviews <br>Surveys 
Concept / Wireframes 	| Interviews
Prototype 				| Card sort
MVP 					| Usability testing
Product 				| Analytics <br>Usability testing

### Quantitative

Observe and **measure**.

Useful to answer **what** and **how** (how much, how often..) types of questions.

How many people do you have? Is it a representative sample of your user base?

How large should your *dataset* be to make sense?

### Qualitative

> Questions, answers, insights and explanations are limited by a researcher’s understanding of users’ behaviours. The only way to increase that understanding is by actually interacting with and investigating behaviours, beliefs, and assumptions outside of our own behaviours, beliefs, and assumptions. 

*From [Bill Selman, User Research Lead at Mozilla](http://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2014/10/why-do-we-conduct-qualitative-user-research/)*

Qualitative research provides methodologies for getting outside of our *homophilic bubble*.

Useful to answer **why** type of questions.



# Exercise

Interview 2 (or more) people about their use of social networks.

Today we plan and test, then you'll recruit and interview your participants.

Write your plan and findings in MarkDown, then push it to your fork of this project on GitHub (inside the `students > {yourName}` folder).

## Good practices for user research

1. **Plan**: prepare a script, know what to ask, and who to ask.
2. **Test** your test (with family and friends).
3. Recruit **strangers**. Remember [homophily](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily)?
4. Go to **their place**, in a space where they're comfortable, best if the space where they use the product(s) you want to test / talk about. Let them show you around.
5. Easier if you interview **pairs** of users: they'll be less anxious.
6. **Listen**. Don't talk about yourself.
8. Be comfortable with **silence**: give people time and space to answer your question.
9. Be ready to **be challenged** and improvise.
10. Avoid **leading questions**. Try not to bias your interviewees.

	bad > *How much do you love using FB?*
	
	good > *Tell me about your most **recent** FB experience*
	
11. Avoid **closed questions**.

	bad > *Do you order A, B or C?*
	
	good > ***How** do you choose food when going out?*	
	
## Plan

**What do you want to find out?**

Pair with a classmate and **jot down** a few questions. These questions will become the **script** for your interviews.

If you have an idea / concept then it's better if you centre your interview questions around that.

Otherwise, you can interview people about their use of social networks (in general).

Finally, if you're stuck, here's a topic you can practice with: imagine you're designing a social app that helps groups of people organise their time out. 

Question examples:

* How did you first learn about `insert your topic`?
* How were you motivated to become involved in `insert your topic`?
* Tell me more about that experience. What do you remember most about it?
* (if the user has started telling you about a relevant experience) What did you enjoy most?What didn't you enjoy about it?
* What kinds of problems do you or your community commonly see in your experience? Have you thought about how you would solve it?

## Test	

Interview each others, in pairs. 

One person conducts the interview, the other takes notes. Swap roles as you please.
