# Wireframes critique

1. Hang your drafts on the wall
2. Grab a pen and some post-its 
3. Let's *critique* each other's drafts

### Critiquette

All comments must be `KASH`:

* **Kind** 
	
	Focus on the work. No sarcasm or personal comments. 
	
	Your comments can be challenging but the creator of the work should feel that your feedback is work-oriented and happy to receive it.
	
* **Actionable**	
	
	Your comments should include **suggestions** or **instructions**, which the creator of the work can simply take away and use.
	
* **Specific** 

	Don't just state `It's (not) good` or `I (don't) like it`. Explain why.
	
	Comment on specific aspects or details of the work, eg: `Navigation labels are unconventional but I wonder if most people would get what they stand for..`
	
* **Helpful** 

	If it doesn't benefit the work, its creator or the class, don't share it.

In a nutshell:
 
> Be hard on content and soft on people!

What's wrong with the wireframes above?


### Better wireframes

Proposed re-design of a social network for topical political debates that aims to promote political awareness and participation amongst young people. 

Used both as a teaching tool in the classroom and by 11-18 year olds in their own time.

Commissioned by the [Hansard Society](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk) in 2011.

### Leading questions

* What is the main **point** of this screen?
* What **questions** could possibly pop up on people's heads while on this screen?
* Is the most **important content** the first thing you notice?
* Is anything important **missing** from this screen?
* Do all of the **labels** make sense?
* Is there anything on this screen that shouldn't be there?
* Can you get to all of the major sections of the app from here? Should you be able to?


## Redraft

Reflect on the feedback and suggestions that you received, ask any clarifications and start redrafting your work.

Drafting and redrafting, making improvements after improvements, is a vital part of the **design process**. Nothing is perfect the first time.

**Keep every copy of your drafts**. We'll ask you to present them during the formative and summative assessments, and they'll be part of the body of work on which you'll be marked.



# User journeys

### Set personas in motion

So by now you should have a couple (or more) **personas** and some **wireframes**.

The next step is to make them collide and see what happens.

Have you created **storyboards** before?

A `user journey` is to an app / website (or generally *software*) what a `storyboard` is to a film. 

It helps us (designers, developers, clients..) visualise and communicate what is going to happen when things start moving.

### Stories

> **Stories** are the most powerful delivery tool for information, more powerful and enduring than any other art form.

> From [Storyboarding & UX](http://johnnyholland.org/2011/10/storyboarding-ux-part-1-an-introduction)

![](http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/storyboarding-freytags-pyramid.jpg)

<!-- Gustav Freytag rationalised stories into five acts: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action (or final suspense and resolution) and dénouement (conclusion). -->

### Storyboarding

> Storyboarding has always been the **low-fidelity prototype of film [and animation]**, bringing together the elements of script, plot, scene, and characters.

UX storyboarding, aka **user journeys** is useful to: 
	
1. Put a **human face** on research data (similar to personas)
2. **Communicate** research data through storytelling (put personas in a  story)
3. **Spark** new design concepts and encourage collaboration (people engage with stories)
4. **Persuade** collaborators or clients (through storytelling)

![](http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/storyboarding-sketch.jpg)

#### You don’t need to be good at drawing

> When thinking about storyboarding, most people get stuck on their (perceived) **inability to draw**. 
 
> From [Storyboarding & UX](http://johnnyholland.org/2011/10/storyboarding-ux-part-2-creating-your-own)

#### What's the point?

> What is far more important *[than your in/ability to draw]* is working out the **point** you wish to make with your storyboard.

> From [Storyboarding & UX](http://johnnyholland.org/2011/10/storyboarding-ux-part-2-creating-your-own)

**What is your UX storyboard about?**



# Your turn!

So what do we storyboard? 

Not just a *fairytale* scenario: your persona as the *hero* and your product as the *magical object*. 

Pick one of these three **themes**:

1. An existing UX **problem** to be solved
* An impact on UX caused by an existing **situation**, or if something isn’t fixed
* A desired UX based on a particular **solution**

Think about 

* **Triggers** What happened to start your story in the first place?
* What is the **goal** your character wants to achieve?
* What is the **final outcome**? Should it show a clear benefit of a solution? Or bring to surface an existing / new problem?


### Ingredients

* Your **persona(s)** aka your story's *character(s)*

	Their behaviours, appearance and expectations, as well as any decisions they make along the way, are very important.

* Your **product** (website / app) can also be considered a *character* in your story, not one with agency but certainly one that your main character(s) interact with throughout the story. In [Vladimir Propp's words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Propp#Narrative_structure), *a magical object* (can be good or bad). 

	Your **wireframes** illustrate how your product behaves.
	
* A **script** to describe the character’s **internal train of thought**, as well as what they say and what others around them say. 

	Revealing what is going on in your character’s mind is integral to a successful illustration of their experience in the storyboard.	
* The **scene** which your character finds herself in. 

	It could be a single place, or switch across several environments and channels, or even just within a single website / app.
	
* A **plot**, that is the narrative that unfolds in your storyboard. 

	It should focus on a **goal** for the character, and the **key moments** involved in achieving (or not) that goal. 
 	
 	It should start with a specific **trigger** and end with either the **benefit** of the solution, or a **problem** that the character is left with. 
 	

### Method

1. Try text or boxes and arrows first

	![](http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/storyboarding-2-01.jpg)
	
2. Add emoticons to each step, to help others get a feel for what’s going on inside the character’s head.	

	![](http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/storyboarding-2-02.jpg)

3. Flesh out your storyboard by translating each moment into a storyboard frame. 

	![](http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/storyboarding-2-03.jpg)
	
	
### Method 2 (iconoclast alternative)
	
> People don’t land on screens from out of nowhere. Specific sequences of actions lead users through your app as they try to accomplish their tasks.

> **Each moment in a flow is like a coin with two sides.**

![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/324-todo-flow.png)

> The screen is showing something on one side, and the user is reacting on the other side. 

> My flow diagrams illustrate this two-sided nature with a bar. 
 
> * Above the bar is what the user sees. 
> * Below the bar is what they do. 
> * An arrow connects the user’s action to a new screen with yet another action.

# Homework

### Redraft your wireframes

Two options:

1. Use [Moqups](http://moqups.com) and then upload your screens to [InVision](http://www.invisionapp.com) to make them clickable.

	**or**

2. If you want to be cool, you can start translating your wireframes into an **HTML + CSS** prototype using a framework like [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/prototyping.html)


### Storyboard another user journey

Pick from the [three *themes* above](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204/blob/master/sessions/session-06.md#your-turn), one that you haven't storyboarded yet.


### Blog

Watch [The Internet's Own Boy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b051wkry/storyville-20142015-11-the-internets-own-boy), a film about Aaron Swartz: wiz-kid, co-founder of Reddit and activist for social justice and freedom of information. 

Heads up! This will be available on BBC iPlayer until the **4th of March 2015**, so you better watch it before then.

Questions that may guide your blog post (in no particular order):

* How do you feel about freedom of information?
* What do you think constitutes *digital theft*?
* How do you feel about [Net Neutrality](http://www.vox.com/cards/network-neutrality/whats-network-neutrality)?
* If you had magical powers, would you use them for good or to make you mountains of cash?


<!--### Examples

* Think about an experience you’ve had with booking a flight online. What sort of flight were you after and why? Where did you start, and what did you do? Using the storyboard template, sketch your experience step-by-step, including anything that went well or went wrong.

* Sketch on your storyboard template what an ideal experience would look like for that audience to book a flight online. What exactly are they after? Where do they start? What ideas for website features can you think of that would make their experience ideal?-->

<!--From [Stop Designing Pages And Start Designing Flows](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/04/stop-designing-pages-start-designing-flows)

> Not all website visitors are created equal. Users come from different sources, with varying levels of knowledge and engagement, and with different goals.-->





<!--From [Storyboarding in the Software Design Process](http://uxmag.com/articles/storyboarding-in-the-software-design-process)

> In their book, Storytelling for User Experience, Whitney Quesenbery and Kevin Brooks offer these benefits of using stories in software design:

They help us gather and share information about users, tasks, and goals.
They put a human face on analytic data.
They can spark new design concepts and encourage collaboration and innovation.
They are a way to share ideas and create a sense of shared history and purpose.
They help us understand the world by giving us insight into people who are not just like us.
They can even persuade others of the value of our contribution.-->

<!--From [user journey maps](http://www.elezea.com/2013/05/one-ux-deliverable)

> * Unique selling points to keep us focused on what the site needs to communicate at all times. This comes straight from the Persona needs and goals.
* Journey stages and model to remind us how the product fit into people’s lives, and what the primary calls to action need to be throughout the site.
* Questions that our target Personas are likely to ask in each phase of the journey, to focus the type of content we serve on each page. In an e-commerce context, these are questions like, “Can I trust this retailer?” or “When will my stuff arrive?”
* Takeaways and key principles to summarise the above sections (which primarily act as problem definitions/requirements) and document how that translates into the design decisions and solutions we need to keep in mind throughout the design process.
* Content plan that maps each phase of the journey with the questions our Personas will ask during that phase, and what it means for the specific content that needs to go on each page. We get very specific here — nothing gets on the page unless it’s in the content plan. And if we can’t identify a Persona that would find the content useful, it just doesn’t go on the list.-->
