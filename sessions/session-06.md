# Wireframes critique

1. Hang your drafts on the wall
2. Grab a pen and some post-its 
3. Let's *critique* each other's drafts

### Leading questions

* Is anything important missing from this screen?
* Is the most important content the first thing you notice?
* Is there anything on this screen that shouldn't be there?
* Do you know what all of the elements on this screen are?
* Can you get to all of the major sections of the app from here? Should you be able to?
* Do all of the labels make sense?

### Critiquette

All comments must be `KASH`:

* **Kind** 
	
	Focus on the work. No sarcasm or personal comments. 
	
	Your comments can be challenging but the creator of the work should feel that your feedback is work-oriented and happy to receive it.
	
* **Actionable**	
	
	Your comments should include **suggestions** or **instructions**, which the creator of the work can simply take away and use.
	
* **Specific** 

	Don't just state `It's (not) good` or `I (don't) like it`. Explain why.
	
	Comment on specific aspects or details of the work, eg: `Navigation labels are unconventional but I wonder if most people would get what they stand for..`
	
* **Helpful** 

	If it doesn't benefit the work, its creator or the class, don't share it.

In a nutshell:
 
> Be hard on content and soft on people!

## Example

Proposed re-design of a social network for topical political debates that aims to promote political awareness and participation amongst young people. 

Used both as a teaching tool in the classroom and by 11-18 year olds in their own time.

Commissioned by the [Hansard Society](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk) in 2011.

## Redraft

Reflect on the feedback and suggestions that you received, ask any clarifications and start redrafting your work.

Drafting and redrafting, making improvements after improvements, is a vital part of the **design process**. Nothing is perfect the first time.

<!--You wouldn't put on a school production without practising it over and over again until it was perfect. -->

**Keep every copy of your drafts**. We'll ask you to present them during the formative and summative assessments, and they'll be part of the body of work on which you'll be marked.



# User journeys

### Set personas in motion

So by now you should have a couple (or more) **personas** and some **wireframes**.

The next step is to make them collide and see what happens.

Have you created **storyboards** before?

<!--Just like a storyboard is a draft visualisation of a film, a--> A user journey is to an app / website (or generally software) what a storyboard is to a film. 

It helps us (designers, developers, clients..) visualise what is going to happen when things start moving.

From [Stop Designing Pages And Start Designing Flows](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/04/stop-designing-pages-start-designing-flows)

> Not all website visitors are created equal. Users come from different sources, with varying levels of knowledge and engagement, and with different goals.

From [A shorthand for designing UI flows](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows)

> Customers don’t land on screens from out of nowhere. Specific sequences of actions lead customers through your app as they try to accomplish their tasks.

> Each moment in a flow is like a coin with two sides.

> The screen is showing something on one side, and the user is reacting on the other side. My flow diagrams illustrate this two-sided nature with a bar. Above the bar is what the user sees. Below the bar is what they do. An arrow connects the user’s action to a new screen with yet another action.

From [Storyboarding & UX](http://johnnyholland.org/2011/10/storyboarding-ux-part-1-an-introduction)

> **Stories** are the most powerful delivery tool for information, more powerful and enduring than any other art form

![](http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/storyboarding-freytags-pyramid.jpg)

> Storyboarding has always been the **low-fidelity prototype of film**, bringing together the elements of script, plot, scene, and characters.

> There are a few specific uses for storyboarding for UX to explore in detail: 
	
1. helping us to think
2. helping others to communicate to us
3. helping us to communicate to others

[Storyboarding & UX – part 2: creating your own](http://johnnyholland.org/2011/10/storyboarding-ux-part-2-creating-your-own/)


From [Storyboarding in the Software Design Process](http://uxmag.com/articles/storyboarding-in-the-software-design-process)

> In their book, Storytelling for User Experience, Whitney Quesenbery and Kevin Brooks offer these benefits of using stories in software design:

They help us gather and share information about users, tasks, and goals.
They put a human face on analytic data.
They can spark new design concepts and encourage collaboration and innovation.
They are a way to share ideas and create a sense of shared history and purpose.
They help us understand the world by giving us insight into people who are not just like us.
They can even persuade others of the value of our contribution.

From [user journey maps](http://www.elezea.com/2013/05/one-ux-deliverable)

> * Unique selling points to keep us focused on what the site needs to communicate at all times. This comes straight from the Persona needs and goals.
* Journey stages and model to remind us how the product fit into people’s lives, and what the primary calls to action need to be throughout the site.
* Questions that our target Personas are likely to ask in each phase of the journey, to focus the type of content we serve on each page. In an e-commerce context, these are questions like, “Can I trust this retailer?” or “When will my stuff arrive?”
* Takeaways and key principles to summarise the above sections (which primarily act as problem definitions/requirements) and document how that translates into the design decisions and solutions we need to keep in mind throughout the design process.
* Content plan that maps each phase of the journey with the questions our Personas will ask during that phase, and what it means for the specific content that needs to go on each page. We get very specific here — nothing gets on the page unless it’s in the content plan. And if we can’t identify a Persona that would find the content useful, it just doesn’t go on the list.



# Your turn!

So what do we storyboard? Not just the hero (your app) scenario. 



# Assignments

### 1. Redraft your wireframes

Two options:

1. Use [Moqups](http://moqups.com) or [WireframeCC](https://wireframe.cc) and then upload your screens to [InVision](http://www.invisionapp.com) to make them clickable.

	**or**

2. If you want to be cool, you can start translating your wireframes into an **HTML + CSS** prototype using a framework like [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/prototyping.html)


### 2. Describe another 2 user journeys 

Success and failure scenarios


### 3. Blog about this film

Watch [The Internet's Own Boy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b051wkry/storyville-20142015-11-the-internets-own-boy), a film about Aaron Swartz: wiz-kid, co-founder of Reddit and activist for social justice and freedom of information. 

Heads up! This will be available on BBC iPlayer until the **4th of March 2015**, so you better watch it before then.

Questions that may guide your blog post (in no particular order):

* How do you feel about freedom of information?
* What do you think constitutes *digital theft*?
* How do you feel about [Net Neutrality](http://www.vox.com/cards/network-neutrality/whats-network-neutrality)?
* If you had magical powers, would you use them for good or to make you mountains of cash?
