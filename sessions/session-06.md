# Wireframes critique

1. Hang your drafts on the wall

3. Let's *critique* each other's drafts

### Leading questions

* Is anything important missing from this screen?
* Is the most important content the first thing you notice?
* Is there anything on this screen that shouldn't be there?
* Do you know what all of the elements on this screen are?
* Can you get to all of the major sections of the app from here? Should you be able to?
* Do all of the labels make sense?

### Critiquette

All comments must be `KASH`:

* **Kind** 
	
	Focus on the work. No sarcasm or personal comments. 
	
	Your comments can be challenging but the creator of the work should feel that your feedback is work-oriented and happy to receive it.
	
* **Actionable**	
	
	Your comments should include **suggestions** or **instructions**, which the creator of the work can simply take away and use.
	
* **Specific** 

	Don't just state `It's (not) good` or `I (don't) like it`. Explain why.
	
	Comment on specific aspects or details of the work, eg: `Navigation labels are unconventional but I wonder if most people would get what they stand for..`
	
* **Helpful** 

	If it doesn't benefit the work, its creator or the class, don't share it.

In a nutshell:
 
> Be hard on content and soft on people!

## Example

Proposed re-design of a social network for topical political debates that aims to promote political awareness and participation amongst young people. 

Used both as a teaching tool in the classroom and by 11-18 year olds in their own time.

Commissioned by the [Hansard Society](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk) in 2011.

## Redraft

Reflect on the feedback and suggestions that you received, ask any clarifications and start redrafting your work.

Drafting and redrafting, making improvements after improvements, is a vital part of the **design process**. Nothing is perfect the first time.

<!--You wouldn't put on a school production without practising it over and over again until it was perfect. -->

**Keep every copy of your drafts**. We'll ask you to present them during the formative and summative assessments, and they'll be part of the body of work on which you'll be marked.



# Assignments

### 1. Redraft your wireframes

Two options:

1. Use [Moqups](http://moqups.com) or [WireframeCC](https://wireframe.cc) and then upload your screens to [InVision](http://www.invisionapp.com) to make them clickable.

	**or**

2. If you want to be cool, you can start translating your wireframes into an **HTML + CSS** prototype using a framework like [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/prototyping.html)


2. Describe another 2 user journeys (success and failure scenarios)

### 2. Blog about this film

Watch [The Internet's Own Boy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b051wkry/storyville-20142015-11-the-internets-own-boy), a film about Aaron Swartz: wiz-kid, co-founder of Reddit and activist for social justice and freedom of information. 

Heads up! This will be available on BBC iPlayer until the **4th of March 2015**, so you better watch it before then.

Questions that may guide your blog post (in no particular order):

* How do you feel about freedom of information?
* What do you think constitutes *digital theft*?
* How do you feel about [Net Neutrality](http://www.vox.com/cards/network-neutrality/whats-network-neutrality)?
* If you had magical powers, would you use them for good or to make you mountains of cash?
