# Week 10

### Today, Monday 25th April 2018

Today's session will kick start your filter bubbles projects and start to shape your work for the term. We will cover: 

* **Data Detox**: Another look at digital data
* **Mobile phone Data**: A class workshop on how your phone works. 
* **Digital Data**: what is it, how do companies collect and use your data, and what can we do about it?
* **Filter bubbles**: the effects of the invisible algorithmic filtering of the Web by companies like Facebook and Google. We'll draw and compare our filter bubbles. 
* **Ideation**: we'll come up with 10 ideas for a *digital object* (an app, a website, a bot, a browser plugin..) that tackles filter bubbles
* **Interviews**: we'll ask people (unbiased) questions to validate our idea(s) 

All the material for today is in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a3CqIB11DHJV-huNM-Y1Y_tMyYJy3yb7TKYiuwmysec/edit#slide=id.g220bfb8030_0_116).

# Homework

Review the 10 concepts that you created in class and assess the interviews that you conducted at Rave. Will you Pivot, persevere or kill you idea? Work through the ideas and modify them so you have a strong concept. Bring **one** for next week that you believe you would like to prototype. 

### Blog

1. Read [this article](https://backchannel.com/facebook-published-a-big-new-study-on-the-filter-bubble-here-s-what-it-says-ef31a292da95) by Eli Pariser (author of *The Filter Bubble*), in which he analyses a study by Facebook data scientists on **filter bubbles vs individual choices**. Then blog about your views on this analysis. Include examples from your own experience of filter bubbles (eg: Did you ever get something offensive or off-putting from a friend/contact on social media? Or an advert that you found irrelevant? How did you feel?).
