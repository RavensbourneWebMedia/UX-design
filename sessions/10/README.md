# Week 10

### Today, Friday 28th April 2017

We'll go to SCWA and work with the students you met last week.

* **Digital data**: what is it, how do companies collect and use your data, and what can we do about it?
* **Algorithms**: we'll learn how to write and *decode* algorithms, in particular *filtering* algorithms.
* **Filter bubbles**: the effects of the invisible algorithmic filtering of the Web by companies like Facebook and Google. We'll draw and compare our filter bubbles. 
* **Ideation**: we'll come up with 10 ideas for a *digital object* (an app, a website, a bot, a browser plugin..) that tackles filter bubbles
* **Interviews**: we'll ask people (unbiased) questions to validate our idea(s) 

All the material for today is in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aeS1devIv-9eVnUuvArntvLG1uvt9YcqsV6q35Pfz0w/edit?usp=sharing).

No homework for this time, because it's Bank Holiday weekend and the next session is right after on Tuesday (2nd of May) :)
