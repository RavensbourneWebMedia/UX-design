# Session 14

### Today, Tuesday 12th May 2015	

1. [Blog posts review](#blogz)
* [Prototypes critique](#prototypes-critique)
* Cognitification 

Your [homework](#homework)!

# Blogz

* **25%** of your [final grade for this unit will be based](../README.md#assessment-criteria) on your blog.

* Blogging is not an exercise to *tick the box* and fill your time. It's an important and effective tool to **document** and **reinforce** your learning. 

* **Documenting** your work is the first step to *productify* your time. Something well-documented can be delegated to someone else (collaborator, employee, client etc). Be smart :)

* Don't limit yourself to the blog posts we assign you to write. **Blog independently**. Include work-in-progress screenshots, hyperlinks, research, inspirations, tweets.. we'll consider these too for your final grade.

# Prototypes critique

Each one of you should have (at least) 10 screens linked up in [Invision](http://www.invisionapp.com).

<!--![](http://www.invisionapp.com/assets/img/home/animations/prototyping-mockup-mobile.gif)-->


1. Open your prototype in Invision
2. Click on the `LiveShare` button 
 
	![](assets/invision-live-share.png)
3. Share the link with us on FB

	It should look like [invis.io/p/CY2YEHUU3](http://invis.io/p/CY2YEHUU3)
4. Let the critique begin


### Questions

* What **principles** guided your design choices?
	
	> For example, I wanted *minimum input* and *just enough information* at any stage.

* What **problem** is this screen addressing?

* What is the **goal** of the interaction on this screen?

* How does this link to your **user stories**?
 
* Which [tools](session-13.md#tools-to-consider) did you use?
* Any **tips&tricks** to share? Cool tricks you discovered or learned?
	
	> For example, I downloaded the [Foundation toolkit for Sketch](http://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/484-sketch-foundation-kit.html) and learned that you can *hide* screens from Invision by simply [adding a **-** to their names](http://blog.invisionapp.com/sketch-meet-rapid-hi-fi-prototyping/)
* What **challenges** did you encounter?

* How are you going to **test** this? 

* What **questions** will you seek to answer when testing your prototype? 

* What will be your **guidelines for feedback**?
