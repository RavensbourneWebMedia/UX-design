Your [homework](#homework)!

# Blogz

* **25%** of your [final grade for this unit will be based](../README.md#assessment-criteria) on your blog.

* Blogging is not an exercise to *tick the box* and fill your time. It's an important and effective tool to **document** and **reinforce** your learning. 

* **Documenting** your work is the first step to *productify* your time. Something well-documented can be delegated to someone else (collaborator, employee, client etc). Be smart :)

* Don't limit yourself to the blog posts we assign you to write. **Blog independently**. Include work-in-progress screenshots, hyperlinks, research, inspirations, tweets.. we'll consider these too for your final grade.
