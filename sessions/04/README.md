# Week 4

### Today, Thursday 28th January 2016

#### AM

1. Each team: **present** the key features and how you plan to user-test them with kids.
* [Prepare a **guide** and a **capture sheet**](#your-turn): how are you going to collect the user-testing feedback?

#### PM

1. At the primary school you'll **user-test** your features and collect feedback through *capture sheets*. 3 sessions of 30 minutes each, with 2-4 children per team.
* Jot down the **top 5 points** from the user-testing sessions (aka *debrief*).

<!-- Split kids into groups of 2 so you test more -->

Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!


# User-testing preparation

1. How are you going to **user-test** this? 
* What **questions** will you seek to answer when testing your idea and wireframes? 
* What will be your **guidelines for feedback**?

### How (not) to user-test

Let's watch and discuss this user-testing video, from a former student

Can you spot a few issues in the way the *facilitator* conducted the test?

<!-- 

	* Explained testers what the app is about, instead of asking them
	* Think out loud if you can
	* What is the point of this test?
	* Facebook tab open before you show the actual thing
	* If there's something important in the bottom-right corner of your screen, it would be better if it wasn't hidden in the final video
	
 -->

#### Do's and dont's

You are the user-testing **facilitator**.

Your main job is to make your testers not feel stupid:

1. State clearly that you're testing the the *thing*, **not them**.
* Reassure them it's not their fault if what they do has an unexpected result.
* Encourage them to **think out loud**.
* **No hints**, instead encourage them to think what they'd do if you weren't there. Ask them what they are thinking or looking for but avoid words like `try`.
* Be kind and **patient**, don't sigh. 
* **Don't take it personally** if they don't get what you think it's obvious, but try and understand why.
* You should look out for **friction points**: those moments when the user stops concentrating on her tasks and starts thinking about the tool and how she is going to use it. Note questioning words, especially where testers question their own judgement, `why can't I find...`, `I expected to see...` etc. as this indicates that the workflow for the task may have broken down.
* **No orders**, but rather give some choice to your testers (eg: *What would you click first?*)
* Allow people to proceed in a task until you don't feel like it's producing any value or they becomes very frustrated.

> The best kind of user test is one where the subject is not influenced by too much direction, they are simply there to use what's in front of them to achieve a goal that you set out before the test began.

### Your turn

1. Prepare a **guide** for your user-testing session. You can take inspiration from this [sample](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17IuAMJojz0dlvBFh7QBDBgUWun2NyRZ6hlRwLdqYcH0/edit?usp=sharing) (*clone* it into a new Google doc).
* Prepare a **capture sheet**: this is based on the questions you'll ask your testers and the tasks they're going to perform. 

	It can either be *private* (just for yourself), or you could make some space in your testing material (wireframes etc.) to let your testers add their own comments and/or sketches. 
* Do a **practice run** with another team, and adjust your capture sheet accordingly. 

<!--
* Look around, what would you click first
* How do you find out more about ...
* Please sign up and go through profile-setting-up process
* 3 options: which one would you go for?
* Search for your favourite book / film / track etc

# Homework

<!--### User-testing debrief

Aggregating responses should take the form of simple tallies related to either task performance (success/failure) or sentiment (like/indifferent/dislike).

See usability test report template.-->

### Use case

Build a *use case*, describing how a particular person uses a particular feature in a particular scenario (min 5 steps).

<!--
The term *use case* is a common source of misunderstanding because it is often used to mean different things. Sometimes people use it to describe:

* a stakeholderâ€™s high-level goal
* a step by step description of system action
* the **flow of how users interact with a system**

As UX designers we usually mean the third kind.
-->

A use case can be **textual**, **visual**, or both (usually both). You can think of it as a *comic* that illustrates how someone uses a specific feature of your product.

A use case is written from a **user's perspective**. 

Sometimes UX people call *use cases* also **user journeys**.

<!--
If you are writing a use case for a leave request system, for example, you would title your use case *booking vacation days* instead of *decide to go on vacation* or *determine number of vacation days*. The user and the system would both be included in the use case as well as any additional people involved, such as a manager who has to approve the leave request. 
-->

#### Method

1. Try text or boxes and arrows first.

2. Add emoticons to each step, to help others get a feel for what's happening inside the user's head.

3. Flesh out your use case by translating each key step into a *comic* frame.

### Formative

Prepare a pitch presentation:

* **What** is your idea?
* **Who** is it for?
* **Why** is it needed?
* What are the **key features**?
* What is the **use case**? 

The points above are the bare minimum of what your presentation should include. You're very welcome to present them in a different order and include any other aspects (such as your *creative process*, what you discovered in your *user interviews* and *user testing*, etc.) which you consider relevant.

#### How long should the presentation be?

Ideally **10 minutes** (max 15 minutes) with another 5 for feedback and Q&A.
