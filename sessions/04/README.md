# User Persona Homework

![](../04/assets/TheSonOfMan.jpg)

Before we create new work today, let's review your [User Persona's](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/UX-design/tree/2018/sessions/03#2-user-personas) from last week. 

# Where does it hurt?

Imagine you're a person (or a *persona*) going through your experience map. 

1. Define a **goal** for your person(a). What does s/he want to achieve through the experience? 

	In other words, what is the *destination* s/he wants to reach in your experience map?
* Simulate the **experience flow**: go through each step with your team and discuss what happens to your person(a).
* For each step, identify potential **pain points**.  
  
	Add emoticons to each step, to visualise what's happening inside your person(a)'s head.

### The riskiest assumption

Going through the *experience flow* and identifying its *pain points* will allow you to uncover the **riskiest assumptions** in your idea. 

An assumption is a prediction for what you think will happen. Will users really behave as you predicted in your experience map?

Your riskiest assumption is both **core** to your idea and **most unknown**, meaning you have little data to prove it's valid. It's important to always test your **riskiest assumption first**.

Here are three examples:

:x: `NMM visitors want to see all of the hidden histories present within the collection through a mobile application`

This is a solution-oriented assumption. Take a step back and ask, *why*?

:x: Because `there isn't enough space in the galleries to showcase all hidden histories alongside all other artefacts`

This is the business-perspective assumption. Not the customer's problem. Ask *why* again.
	
:heavy_check_mark: Because `visitors are inquisative about hidden history stories within the museum`  
  
This assumption is defined from the customer's perspective (and should be linked to something visitors told you during your interviews).

<!--
When you're testing a customer-perspective assumption, your riskiest assumption is one that supports the belief that your customer *has that problem*. 

In a problem-solution case, the riskiest assumption is that it's *the right solution* to solve the problem. 
-->

<!--
#### What makes a good experiment?

To prototype and test effectively, you need to **turn your assumptions into hypotheses** and then build an **experiment** to test the **riskiest** one.

A good experiment is:

1. cheap
* quick
* has the highest possible learning potential

You can create good experiments by building a *landing page* (remember [Buffer](#the-buffer-story)?) or by creating *prototypes* that simulate the aspects of your experience where the riskiest assumption lives.

Prototypes are likely the most appropriate tool for the kind of project we're working on this term ([DAX](../../projects/dax)).
-->

### Prototyping (to experiment)

Prototype, either on paper or digitally the part of your experience where the riskiest assumption lies.

<!--
We're familiar with paper prototyping (here's a [great video-example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g4GGtJ8NCY).
-->

Over the next four weeks you'll iterate and test your prototypes with real visitors at NMM, several times!

A few tips:

* Use **realistic content**.

	As designers we're good at spotting *placeholder* text or images, however not everyone is familiar with them and sometimes people get hung up on details or ask `Why is that text in a foreign language?` (lorem ipsum).  
	
	Avoid *lorem ipsum* and stock photos like the plague! 
	
	You can find [real hidden histories from the NMM collection here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/UX-design/blob/2018/sessions/03/assets/NMM_Hidden_Histories_Stories.pdf).

* How good is **good enough**?

	You want to strike a balance between the time it takes to build the prototype, and how close to the real thing you need it to be for your user-testing to be effective. 
	
	 When user-testing, it's crucial that you explain to people that this is **not a finished product** (even though it looks obvious to you) and that you are not testing colours, animations etc. 

* Avoid **linear click-throughs**. 

	Even if there's one single call to action per screen, your prototype should offer a couple of options to users.

* Create **reusable** styles and symbols.

	There are ways to do it in every prototyping tool. 
	
	If you catch yourself building the same button twice, that's an alarm bell: you should turn it into a *symbol* (or *smart object*, or whatever your tool of choice calls them).
	
*	Use **real devices** when testing. 

	If you're designing a mobile app, get the prototype on your mobile. If you're designing for a tablet, get the prototype on a tablet.

1 week until the **formative presentations on the 5th of Feb**!

Let's plan the next 7 days & what you need to complete:

1. On post-its, write down everything that needs doing
* Together we'll discuss priorities (what needs to be done first) and assign tasks to people.   


# Homework

### Prep formative

Next Monday (5th Feb) you will present your work-in-progress at the NMM. 

Remember, this is a **formative presentation**, which gives you a chance to **get feedback** from the museum experts and **ask questions** to them. 

Talk about your **research**: what you learned from interviewing museum visitors, and what you observed at NMM and/or other museums.

Explain how your concept relates to the interests and needs of your **audience**.

You can use your elevator pitch, concept one-pager, experience map and prototype(s) to describe and visualise your idea.

**Make sure you have some questions to ask to the museum experts**. They're not there to judge you, but to help you make design decision about your idea. Think about how you can you take advantage of their experience and knowledge. What could you ask them? What could they help you with?


### User-test your prototype

Go to NMM and user-test your prototype with visitors. 

**Do at least two sessions over the next two weeks, and test at least four people per session!**

Take notes, write down your observations between one person and the next, record people (audio/video) if you can.

### Blog

Write your observations about user-testing at NMM. What did you learn **about your prototype** and what did you learn **about user-testing as a UX method**?
