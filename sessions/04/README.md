# Tutorials

Claim your team's tutorial slot on [this GDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ArfHiJFohSsvcbQ5Qtq0r6h3GZmiquCLoG7tvGKb2RQ/edit?usp=sharing)!

This afternoon you will present your work-in-progress at the NMM. 

Remember, this is a **formative presentation**, which gives you a chance to **get feedback** from the museum experts and **ask questions** to them. 

Talk about your **research**: what you learned from interviewing museum visitors, and what you observed at NMM and/or other museums.

Explain how your concept relates to the interests and needs of your **audience**.

You can use your elevator pitch, concept one-pager, experience map and prototype(s) to describe and visualise your idea.

**Make sure you have a few questions to ask to the museum experts**. They're not there to judge you, but to help you make design decision about your idea. Think about how you can you take advantage of their experience and knowledge. What could you ask them? What could they help you with?


# Homework

### User personas

#### Why personas?

Whenever we design for a group of users that are not ourselves (which means, always) we make assumptions about their behaviours, goals and needs, attitudes, skills etc.  

A common tool to *get to know your assumptions* about a group of user is creating a user persona.

[Alan Cooper introduced user personas](http://www.cooper.com/journal/2008/05/the_origin_of_personas) as a methodology to solve the **elastic user** problem. As designers, we are tempted to stretch the user to fit almost perfectly to whatever you are designing. The vagueness of the user causes many design failures, because the user is too elastic. We therefore need something much more specific.

A user persona allows you to visualise users with **common behavioural patterns** in their purchasing decisions, use of technology or products, customer service preferences, lifestyle choices, etc.

#### What dimensions are used to cluster users into a persona?

1. **Behaviours**: what users do
2. **Attitudes**: what users expect
3. **Motivations**: what users want / need
4. **Limitations**: what blocks them from doing what they want / need

**Demographics** are not really that useful.

#### Your turn

Create (at least) two user personas for your interactive exhibit.

Base your personas on the people you have interviewed (eg: this persona is based on four people we interviewed, and they all stated X and Y).

If you desperately need a template, you could [use this as a starting point](http://www.ux-lady.com/diy-user-personas/) but don't just mindlessly copy it. Think of what **dimensions** will be useful in the design process.

Please no gimmicky graphs, unless they're based on research data and tell us something useful about the cluster of people they describe.

### Blog

1. Review the **formative feedback** your received.
2. **Individually** jot down an *action plan*: list what you want to do in order to address that feedback (eg: `prototype alternative game mechanics`, `try maps of obscure places`, `brainstorm different names`, `wireframe two options for the welcome screen`)
3. **Compare** your action plan list with your team mates.
4. Blog about this process, reflecting on the feedback received and how you (both individually and as a team) are responding to it.
