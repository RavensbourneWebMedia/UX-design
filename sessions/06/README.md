# User-testing your prototype

### What have you learned so far about user-testing? 

Share some stories, discuss [tips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0f50mVLfud9Y3fYCpPdtmcZ3scuJvaBq6nHGVjJrgs/edit#heading=h.mkklaycrp9q9).

### Prepare a user-testing guide

Let's spend a few minutes to prepare a guide for a user-testing session at NMM this afternoon.

Write down:

* what assumptions do you want to test?
* how can you test them?
* what tasks will you ask testers to perform?
* what context questions will you ask them at the beginning?

[Here is an example user-testing guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BFktaf9BfkCLFq1ONkfNRJ4tIUZNB6BvOTxzZkVeAso/edit?usp=sharing) from Johnny at Campus Society.


# Homework

### Blog

In preparation for the summative presentation (and for your future career) read how to [use storytelling to effectively communicate your research](https://blog.intercom.com/get-the-most-out-of-your-research-storytelling/), then blog about:

1. Your 3 take-aways from the article 
* How could you tell the story of your project, and the research evidence you collected through interviews and user-testing @ NMM? 

### Concept video

Concept videos allow you to tell a compelling story around your idea, even if you haven't built a prototype yet!

Did you know that Dropbox first MVP (*minimal viable product*) was [a concept video](https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/dropbox-minimal-viable-product/)? [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4eTR7tci6A).

You can capture interest with a vivid **problem description**, and convince people with a **backstory** or examples of how people will benefit from you concept.

Here are some more concept video examples:

* [Lily](https://www.lily.camera/) is a drone camera that follows you. It raised millions on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) (another great source of concept video inspiration) with a concept video that ~faked~ simulated how the product would work. 
* [StartupVideos](http://startup-videos.com/) features loads of concept videos for you to get inspired

Using [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com) (free, online) **create a Minimum Viable Video for your NMMaps concept!**

We'll review it next week.

### User-test your prototype

Go to NMM and user-test your prototype with visitors. 

Take notes, write down your observations between one person and the next, and record people (audio/video) if you can.
