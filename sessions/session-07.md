Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)! 
	
# A reminder
	
[Here is a checklist](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204/blob/master/sessions/session-09.md#checklist-for-presentations) of what we want you to present during your formative assessment in 2 weeks.


# User-testing

Here's a link to [Amy's presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwa-zerzlWL6WXY1bDRLS2tlX2I0UEVpaklQRy11SWF6MGZ3/view?usp=sharing)!

### Why?

* Because we can't design on **assumptions** only, we need some **evidence**
* Because when we work on something (anything) we gradually lose a fresh, **unbiased view** of it
* Because people may have different **mental models** than ours
* Because we need to spot and correct **problems** as early as possible
* Because loads of **usable** features may not be **useful** (your client priorities may not be users' priorities)
* Because the way you call things may not be the way users refer to them (test your *copy*.. if you know what [copy](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Copywriting_is_Interface_Design.php) means in the context of interface design)

### When?

* End of design?
* Once you're live?
* **Now**?

### How many?

* Do you think itâ€™s more effective to test 100 people or 10?

* Is it better to test 100 people once or 10 people twice? 

<!-- Test many times, few people at a time -->

User-testing is **iterative**, you should do small tests as often as possible, not just once.

### Who?

Ideally you'd pick someone who's **representative** of your target audience, but following the principle that *some testing is way better than no testing* you can pick anyone really: friends, relatives and colleagues.

## Types of user-testing

### Quantitative vs qualitative

* **Quantitative** testing is used to observe and measure behaviour, generally resulting in statistical data. 

	**Surveys**, **tree testing** and **analytics** are quantitative methods. 

* **Qualitative** testing is used to gather insights on what users are experiencing when they behave or why.

	**Interviews** and **lab testing** are the most common qualitative methods. 	

### Remote vs face2face

* In **remote testing** respondents are always contacted remotely, usually via the Web.

* **Face2face testing** is held with the user in person. 

	Ideally you would have a *facilitator* conduct the test while you observe and take notes. 

	This is because it's tricky not to *feel personally attached* to something you've made, also you may be tempted to *give directions* to users and they may feel *less inclided to express their honest feelings* if they know you've made the thing they're testing. 

	However, affording a facilitator is not always possible so you may have to be the facilitator of your own face2face tests.

	It's vital to **take notes** and highly recommended to **record** user-tests. 

	You can use [Silverback](http://silverbackapp.com) to video-record your sessions on any device with a front-facing camera. The result is a video that shows you both the screen people are interacting with, and they're faces while they're testing (and their voices too).

	[Download Silverback](http://silverback.s3.amazonaws.com/silverback2.zip)

Most types of testing can be done both remotely and face2face.


# Usability testing

Let's warm up with some remote usability testing.

1. Sign up for a free account on [UsabilityHub](https://usabilityhub.com/?r=30141), take a few tests to see what it's like and get inspired about what you can test. 

2. Create one test (or more if you feel like). You can choose between 3 types of test:

	* **Five Second** to capture your users' first impressions
	* **Click Test** to understand what your users click
	* **Nav Flow** to see if your users can successfully get from A to B

3. Make the test public (private tests are not free, anyway) and then share the URL with your friends on Facebook, with your followers on Twitter etc. 

4. Your mission is to get at least 20 tests by the end of today. Can you do that?


# Face2face

Let's watch and discuss this user-testing video, from a former student

Can you spot a few issues in the way the *facilitator* conducted the test?

<!-- 

	* Explained testers what the app is about, instead of asking them
	* Think out loud if you can
	* What is the point of this test?
	* Facebook tab open before you show the actual thing
	* If there's something important in the bottom-right corner of your screen, it would be better if it wasn't hidden in the final video

# Homework

### Conduct a face2face user-test of your wireframes

You will be the *facilitator* and your main job is to make your testers not feel stupid:

* state clearly that you're testing the the app, not them
* reassure them it's not their fault if what they do has an unexpected result
* encourage them to **think out loud**
* **no hints**, instead encourage them to think what they'd do if you weren't there
* be kind and **patient** 
* **don't take it personally** if they don't get what you think it's obvious, but try and understand why
* ask **specific questions**
* no orders, but rather give some choice to your testers (eg: *What would you click first?*)

1. Prepare a loose script for your user-testing session. You can take inspiration from this [sample script](https://hackpad.com/Sample-usertesting-script-UTHN25ekYIQ)

2. Download and install [Silverback](http://silverbackapp.com)

	If it doesn't work, you can use PhotoBooth and QuickTime for screen recording.

	Windows users, I'm sorry but you're on your own :)

3. Find at least 2 people to test your wireframes with. 

	They should not be your mum / dad / sibling / boyfriend / girlfriend. 

	The most interesting and useful insights come from people that are unbiased and not connected to you personally, so try and find someone outside of your *comfort zone*.

	You may offer them a **small reward** for giving you their time. Buy them a coffee, or a little present.


### Blog 

Write about the results of your [remote testing](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204/blob/master/sessions/session-07.md#warm-up-exercise)

You should aim to collect at least 20 results for your tests. 

The more data you gather the more insight for your project.

Questions to lead your blogging:

* What aspects of your design did you test?
* What type(s) of test did you go for (5second, nav flow, preference..)?
* What questions did you ask in your test(s) and how do you think they influenced the way people took the test(s)?
* How did you recruit people to test?
* What results did you get back? Anything useful or surprising?
