1. [What is this course about?](../../README.md)
* [What will you do?](../../README.md#projects)
* [What can you learn?](../../README.md#learning-goals)
* [What's the plan?](../../README.md#plan)   
* [Rules of the road](../../README.md#rules-of-the-road).
* Keeping a **journal** to record your creative process is *extremely* important. Don't let your ideas and thoughts fade away! Think of your project blog as your **digital sketchbook**. More on that [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging).

	A few observations:
	
	* Blog **regularly** as in week by week, not all in one lump. Capture your ideas whilst they're fresh!
	* Write for yourself, not to please me.
	* When you reference an external resource (something you've seen, read or learned about somewhere else on the Web) always link to it
	* Use a spell-checker.
	* Read your writings out loud. It'll help you spot mistakes and make your written thoughts flow.
	* simple ≠ simplistic (which means oversimplified and has a negative connotation)
	* complex ≠ complicated (which means it could be simplified, and has a negative connotation)
