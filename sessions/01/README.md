# Welcome

1. [What is this course about?](../../README.md)
* [What will you do?](../../README.md#projects)
* [What can you learn?](../../README.md#learning-goals)
* [What's the plan?](../../README.md#plan)   
* [Rules of the road](../../README.md#rules-of-the-road).
* Keeping a **journal** to record your creative process is *extremely* important. Don't let your ideas and thoughts fade away! Think of your project blog as your **digital sketchbook**. More on that [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging).

	A few observations:
	
	* Blog **regularly** as in week by week, not all in one lump. Capture your ideas whilst they're fresh!
	* Write for yourself, not to please me.
	* When you reference an external resource (something you've seen, read or learned about somewhere else on the Web) always link to it
	* Use a spell-checker.
	* Read your writings out loud. It'll help you spot mistakes and make your written thoughts flow.
	* simple ≠ simplistic (which means oversimplified and has a negative connotation)
	* complex ≠ complicated (which means it could be simplified, and has a negative connotation) 


# What is UX?

![](assets/design-vs-UX.jpg)

There are many ways of understanding **U**ser e**X**perience. 

<!-- [Here](http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions) is a pool of definitions found from the literature and on the Web. --> 

### Your turn

In pairs, read [these UX definitions](http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions) and pick your favourite one, or jot down your own definition / interpretation of UX, as you currently understand it. We'll then discuss them all together.

<!-- UX design is about effectively addressing the **needs** and **circumstances** of your **users**, to produce interactive products that are **comfortable** and even **joyful** to use. -->

<!-- > All the aspects of **how people use an interactive product**: the way it feels in their hands, how well they understand how it works, how they feel about it while they’re using it, how well it serves their purposes, and how well it fits into the entire context in which they are using it. -->

<!-- * **User-centred** approach (*user personas*) vs **activity-centred** approach (*user stories*). We'll do a bit of both. -->

### What is a prototype? How do we you make one?

* Prototypes answer **questions**: the more specific the better.

* Prototypes stand between your ideas (**assumptions**) and your users (**behaviours**).

* Prototypes should be quick and **cheap** to make, re-make and possibly discard.

* Prototype should be **close** to the real thing.

* We'll start with sketches on paper (**paper-prototypes**), and then move on to **digital prototypes**.

<!--## Why mobile-first?

* Embrace the **diversity** of devices people are accessing the Web from (2015 is *the* year mobile Web traffic will overtake *desktop* Web traffic, according to predictions that I should link to..)

* Starting from the small screens (and less capable hardware) makes you **focus** on what really matters

* Give yourself a **performance budget** (how much can this page weigh on a mobile phone? how long should it take to load on a 3G connection?)-->


# Peer learning

### Designing for kids

In teams, read and discuss this article: [Designing Web interfaces for kids](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/) by [Trine Falbe](https://twitter.com/trinefalbe).

1. Read and annotate (on a Google doc, mind-map, paper sketch.. up to you) the general parts (*Paradigm shift*, *The brain of a kid* and *What affects how kids use the Web?*), share your notes with everyone else on Slack.
* Each team focuses on one of the [design guidelines](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#the-guidelines):

	Who | Which guideline
	--- | ---------------
	Jonny and Harry and Tom | [Simple data entry](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#simple-data-entry)
	Ade and Rana | [Buttons rather than text links](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#buttons-rather-than-text-links)
	Johan and Jack | [Use icons and images](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#use-icons-and-images)
	Kieran and Sanj | [Search](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#search-use-auto-complete-and-visual-search-for-young-kids-older-kids-can-use-more-complex-search)
	Zac and Alex | [Design for social](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#design-for-social)
	Ryder and Ollie | [Provide information and instructions “just in time” and “on demand”](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#provide-information-and-instructions-just-in-time-and-on-demand)
	Joe and Luke | [Design for playfulness](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#design-for-playfulness-gamify)
	
	For each guideline, try and find one or more examples of Web products that implement your guideline, **both good and bad examples**.
* Present your findings to the rest of the class, and share your notes on Slack.

# Project

### Kidesign

On this **team project** you will learn the methods and tools of *user research* and *iterative design*, by engaging with a challenging user group: primary school children. 

All the project material is [here](../../projects/kidesign).

Today and until next week: 

1. Form teams.
* Jot down your areas of interest / first ideas. 
* Start analysing the competition (see [homework below](#competitor-analysis)).

# Homework

### Competitor analysis

Find 2-3 kids products / apps that are relevant to your team's area of interest. 

For each product / app:

1. Read **reviews** about it.
* **Use it** and make notes about 
	
	* **Audience**: who is this product for, primarily and secondarily? 
	
		What are the user **goals**, ie what are they using the product for?
	
	* The **relationships** the product enables. 
		
		Can users connect with other users? 
		
		What are the steps to connect (and disconnect)?

	* **Content**: what kind of content(s) are users producing, sharing and consuming on this product?  
  
		As a designer, how could you *scaffold* users interactions around content?

	* **Content definitions**: what are *things* called?
		
		Is it `friends` or `contacts` or `buddies` or ... ?

		Is it `like` or `love` or `appreciate` or `agree` or `+1` or ... ? 

		And what implications could those choice of words have? For example, how do you `like` a post about a missing cat, or someone's death? Are all your connections really `friends`?

		In particular, consider the **calls to action** (eg: `Buy this`, `Sign up today`, `Follow me`, `Send`, `Post` etc), which are usually found in buttons. What is the product asking users to do?
		
	* **Language**: how does the product *talk* to users?

		Is the tone *formal* or *informal*, *plain* or *technical*, *sophisticated* or *unpretentious*, *active* or *passive*, etc.?

		In what person does the product talk: `we`, `I`, `you`?

		Is it `your profile` or `my profile`? 

		What feelings do you think they are trying to trigger in the audience? 

	* **Onboarding**: user *onboarding* is the process of increasing the likelihood that *new users* adopt your product and keep using it.

		How does the product onboard new users?

		See these very good analyses of user onboarding at [useronboard.com](http://www.useronboard.com).

	* **Blank slate**: *I just signed up, what do I do now?*
	
		An app may feel without life and empty before the user has started to enter data into it. This is an opportunity to motivate the user to start using the app, by showing examples (sample content, screenshots) and best practices (seeds).

		[More about blank slates here](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/BlankSlate).	
	* **Usability and usefulness** (mind the difference) in relation to its audience. 
* Jot down what **could be re-designed** or improved (any ideas).
* If you have a chance, **observe a child** using it and write down your observations. 

### Blog
 
Read and blog about this article: [Interviewing humans](https://medium.com/research-things/interviewing-humans-fa198f809c40). 

Have you interviewed anyone before?   
  
If **yes**: 

* What worked? 
* What could have been better?
* Anything that surprised you?
* What did you do with the data collected during your interview(s)?
