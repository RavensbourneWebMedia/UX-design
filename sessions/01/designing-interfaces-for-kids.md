1989: first Simpsons episode, and the Web was born

Old people like Matteo grew up in an **analogue paradigm**

Internet paradigm

We are just **spamming** kids with ads - and they don’t even know it. 

At the **age of 2** kids use **touch screens**!

Kids (and people our age/under 26) are too young to understand their own actions, so when they get spammed they don’t really know what they are doing. - Which could result in them downloading things they shouldn’t. 

My Grandparents filled their PC with Malware, my 11 year old cousin is like the queen of FarmVille.

Design the way children learn, for example *they read before they can write* 

Kids result to the conventions they know for example, *buttons for navigation* 

Kids have a different approach to *loading time*..

### Key interaction elements

Trine concentrates on 7-12 year-olds

* 2 year-old: develop sense of self, can swipe iPad, no keyboard or mouse

* 6: can start to concentrate for longer and feel empathy, control mouse

* 10: develop decent motor skills, they have no ability to think *abstractly*, they can’t fully predict the consequences of their actions until...

* 26: brain is fully developed :P

Kids use Youtube and interfaces with lots of images and buttons, few text. The know very well play/pause/reload/stop

### Design guidelines

1. Simple data entry, because motor skills aren’t fully developed until age 10	[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is really bad with that

2. Use buttons, not text links for navigationKids recognise them from apps they used before (mental models.. *buttons are for clicking*)

3. Use icons and images, not just textEg [National Geographic Kids](http://ngkids.co.uk/) 

4. Don’t reposition the navigation when redesigning (positions are stored in muscle-memory)

5. Use voice-over sounds for small kids (and let them turn it off), eg: [teacher.scholastic.com/activities/dinosaurs/](http://teacher.scholastic.com/activities/dinosaurs/)

6. Search: use auto-complete and visual search for small kids

7. Design for social, because most kids use computers with someone elseeg [DIY.org](https://diy.org/)

8. Provide instructions "on demand", as most kids learn from *post-failure*

9. Design for play, they will turn anything into a competition. 

10. Test, test, test!


# Peer learning

### [Design for playfulness](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#design-for-playfulness-gamify)

Kids learn through play.

Games exploit kids, through in-app purchases, eg: Smurf's Village

Good examples: [Tocaboca](http://tocaboca.com). *Pure play*: open-ended fun from a kid's perspective.

Don't rely on reading skills, don't rely on verbal language

### [Search](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#search-use-auto-complete-and-visual-search-for-young-kids-older-kids-can-use-more-complex-search)

Challenges: spelling, keywords-based search (eg: Patrick)

[Kidzsearch](http://www.kidzsearch.com/), a search service powered by Google

> What if they knew what they were searching for?

Can we move away from a keyword-based paradigm?

### [Simple data entry](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#simple-data-entry)

[Togetherville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togetherville): access via parents' Facebook

Passcode vs password vs visual patterns

There's not a defined solution to log in kids safely, no one cracked it yet.

Unified password?

### [Buttons rather than text links](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#buttons-rather-than-text-links)

Buttons: elements that look like they're clickable, they stand out

* Keep the look of buttons **consistent**
* **Images**: kids respond more to them
* Stick to **conventions** with icons: play / pause / next etc.

### [Use icons and images](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#use-icons-and-images)

Kids recognise images more than texts.

For example: [Y8](http://www.y8.com/), [Moshi Monsters](http://www.moshimonsters.com/welcome), [CBeebies](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/) (good and bad, as some of the images used for buttons are scattered across the background) 

### [Design for social](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#design-for-social)

More than 30% of the kids in the study primarily used a computer or tablet together with other kids.

History: from games on the World *Wild* Web to apps (walled gardens).

Club Penguin: no free text, choose from options.

DIY.org: community of makers

[Science Museum games](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/online_science/games)

### [Provide information and instructions “just in time” and “on demand”](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/#provide-information-and-instructions-just-in-time-and-on-demand)
