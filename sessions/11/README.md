# In the previous episodes

What the class learnt last time - tools and methods: personas, paper prototyping, we are concentrating on digital prototyping

<!-- 
- [ ] **Being professional**: if you say YES and then can't make it, you need to update me. Best if you do it in writing (by email), so that we don't forget. 

	When it's in your **calendar**, it means that you have a **commitment** to other people. The point is not whether we use this or that tool, the point is that you need to take **responsibility** for your commitments. 

	This stuff can make or break your **reputation**. It boils down to the question: *Can I trust him/her*? If I can't be sure that you will turn up, then the answer is no. 
	
	See Ramit's video about the invisible consequences of a bad reputation.

# Team project

 intro to the brief..


# Lighting talk

Our guest Amy Jackson-Bruce (Web Media alumna) will inspire you with a [pecha-kucha](http://www.pechakucha.org/) (20 slides, 20 seconds each) presentation on digital projects in galleries and museums.


# Workshop

brain swarming - your goal at the top and your resources at the bottom - you get 2 mins to write down your ideas then pass it on to someone else, Matteo to show some examples.


# Field research


120 PM: Field research visit to the NMM and ideation session with students about ideas for projects. All groups to leave with a variety of project ideas. Make some observations - What interests you in the museum? A collection as a whole, or a single object? What is inspiring about that part of the museum? A fact, history or look, feel of the object / objects? How are people invited to engage with the items in the museum? How are people moving around the space? Think about the museum as a website, how are people using the space, what info do they need etc..
Homework: form teams, create personas based on your observations
