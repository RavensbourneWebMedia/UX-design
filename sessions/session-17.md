# Presentation checklist

This is a list of topics that your presentation *should* touch upon. 

* The **context**
	* What is the *issue* (or issues) your project addresses?
	* What *causes* the issue(s)?
	* Who are the *people affected* by the issue(s)?

* The **goal**
	* *Why* are you working on this?
	* What do you regard as *success* for this unit?
	* How can you take this project further *beyond this unit*? 

* The **research**	
	* [Competitor analysis](session-02.md#competitor-analysis) 
	* [User interviews](session-03.md#exercise)
	* [User personas](session-04.md#user-personas)	
	* [Behavioural design](session-14.md#designing-behaviours)

* The **experiments**
	* [Wireframes](session-05.md#wireframing) at different stages: from paper sketches to digital wireframes
	* [User journeys](session-06.md#user-journeys): *onboarding*, how to deal with user mistakes 
	* [Prototypes](session-13.md#your-turn) in Invision / Muse. You should have ~30 screens 
	* [User-testing](session-15.md#user-testing-preparation): both [usability tests](session-07.md#usability-testing) and [face2face sessions](session-15.md#let-them-in-). What did you learn from testing your ideas and prototypes with people, and how did you integrate their feedback into your design?

	* [Motivational copy](session-10.md#your-turn)
	* [Engagement email](session-11.md#engagement-exercise)

Your presentation doesn't have to follow the same order in which topics are outlined here. **Structure your presentation as it makes sense to you**. Remember, we do value creativity after all ;)
