# Prototypes critique

Each one of you should have (at least) 10 screens linked up in [Invision](http://www.invisionapp.com).

1. Open your prototype in Invision
2. Click on the `LiveShare` button 
 
	![](assets/invision-live-share.png)
3. Share the link with us on FB

	It should look like [invis.io/p/CY2YEHUU3](http://invis.io/p/CY2YEHUU3)
4. Let the critique begin
5. Everyone jot down their comments and suggestions on [**this Google spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ipb7AgxoWbjOZ0CzsvCHTO847nbSPWetsVsYeT6xDs/edit?usp=sharing)




### Questions

* What **principles** guided your design choices?
	
	> For example, I wanted **minimum input** and **just enough information** at any stage.

* What **problem** is this screen addressing?

* What is the **goal** of the interaction on this screen?

* How does this link to your **user stories**?
 
* Which [tools](session-13.md#tools-to-consider) did you use?
* Any **tips&tricks** to share? Cool tricks you discovered or learned?
	
	> For example, I downloaded the [Foundation toolkit for Sketch](http://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/484-sketch-foundation-kit.html) and learned that you can *hide* screens from Invision by simply [adding a **-** to their names](http://blog.invisionapp.com/sketch-meet-rapid-hi-fi-prototyping/)
* What **challenges** did you encounter?

### In preparation to the user-testing session this afternoon

* How are you going to **user-test** this? 

* What **questions** will you seek to answer when testing your prototype? 

* What will be your **guidelines for feedback**?




# User-testing preparation

Let's watch and discuss this user-testing video, from a former student

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204/master/sessions/assets/silverback-user-testing-sample.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B01q99xxaTw_Mk5Ua3pyOVJzSFU/view?usp=sharing)

Can you spot a few issues in the way the *facilitator* conducted the test?

<!-- 

	* Explained testers what the app is about, instead of asking them
	* Think out loud if you can
	* What is the point of this test?
	* Facebook tab open before you show the actual thing
	* If there's something important in the bottom-right corner of your screen, it would be better if it wasn't hidden in the final video
	
 -->

### Do's and dont's

You are the user-testing **facilitator**.

Your main job is to make your testers not feel stupid:

* State clearly that you're testing the the app, not them
* Reassure them it's not their fault if what they do has an unexpected result
* Encourage them to **think out loud**
* **No hints**, instead encourage them to think what they'd do if you weren't there. Ask them what they are thinking or looking for but avoid words like `try`.
* Be kind and **patient**, don't sigh. 
* **Don't take it personally** if they don't get what you think it's obvious, but try and understand why
* You should look out for incidents where the user stops concentrating on her tasks and starts thinking about the tool and how she is going to use it. Note questioning words, especially where testers question their own judgement, `why can't I find...`, `I expected to see...` etc. as this indicates that the workflow for the task may have broken down.
* No orders, but rather give some choice to your testers (eg: *What would you click first?*)
* Allow people to proceed in a task until you don't feel like it's producing any value or they becomes very frustrated.

> The best kind of user test is one where the subject is not influenced by too much direction, they are simply there to use what’s in front of them to achieve a goal that you set out before the test began.



### Your turn

1. Prepare a script for your user-testing session. You can take inspiration from this [sample script](https://docs.google.com/a/rave.ac.uk/document/d/1bJ5S-Ws50dDJpjX5iZgmISV0u_l30s7UT2J0S6dcNn8/edit?usp=sharing) (*clone* it into a new Google doc).

	* Look around, what would you click first
	* How do you find out more about ...
	* Please sign up and go through profile-setting-up process
	* 3 options: which one would you go for?
	* Search for your favourite book / film / track etc 


2. Download and install [Silverback](http://silverbackapp.com)

	If it doesn't work, try [CamWiz](http://www.camwizapp.com/)

	Windows users, you can use [Microsoft Expression Encoder Screen Capture](http://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/download/confirmation.aspx?id=10732) or [BB FlashBack Express](http://www.bbsoftware.co.uk/BBFlashBack_FreePlayer.aspx)

# Let them in :)

We should have about 6 guest users that you kindly recruited.

Each user-testing session should last about 20 minutes, so you should get to test your project with 2-3 guests.

Make sure you ask them if it's ok to record their session, check all the [do's and dont's](#dos-and-donts) for user-testing and **take notes**!  

If they're bringing their laptops/phones it's a good idea to share the link to your prototype with them and ask them to test it on their devices, so that they *feel at home*. 

Otherwise, check if they are familiar with the system on which you're testing, eg: *Have you used a Mac / PC / Android / iPhone before?*



# Debrief 

What worked, what didn’t, how to improve.. debate.



# Homework

### User-test

Conduct and record **another user-testing** session with one or more people.

### Blog

Watch recorded tests, analyse them and write up a **user-testing report**: 
 
* What did you find out?
* Did you observe any **emerging patterns** (eg: similar comments from different people, similar obstacles they got stuck on)?  
* How are you going to fold their feedback into your design? Put together a list of **action items**
* What did you learn about **user-testing in general**?
