# Prototypes critique

Each one of you should have (at least) 10 screens linked up in [Invision](http://www.invisionapp.com).

1. Open your prototype in Invision
2. Click on the `LiveShare` button 
 
	![](assets/invision-live-share.png)
3. Share the link with us on FB

	It should look like [invis.io/p/CY2YEHUU3](http://invis.io/p/CY2YEHUU3)
4. Let the critique begin
5. Everyone jot down their comments and suggestions on [**this Google spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ipb7AgxoWbjOZ0CzsvCHTO847nbSPWetsVsYeT6xDs/edit?usp=sharing)




### Questions

* What **principles** guided your design choices?
	
	> For example, I wanted **minimum input** and **just enough information** at any stage.

* What **problem** is this screen addressing?

* What is the **goal** of the interaction on this screen?

* How does this link to your **user stories**?
 
* Which [tools](session-13.md#tools-to-consider) did you use?
* Any **tips&tricks** to share? Cool tricks you discovered or learned?
	
	> For example, I downloaded the [Foundation toolkit for Sketch](http://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/484-sketch-foundation-kit.html) and learned that you can *hide* screens from Invision by simply [adding a **-** to their names](http://blog.invisionapp.com/sketch-meet-rapid-hi-fi-prototyping/)
* What **challenges** did you encounter?

### In preparation to the user-testing session this afternoon

* How are you going to **user-test** this? 

* What **questions** will you seek to answer when testing your prototype? 

* What will be your **guidelines for feedback**?




# User-testing preparation

Let's watch and discuss this user-testing video, from a former student

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204/master/sessions/assets/silverback-user-testing-sample.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B01q99xxaTw_Mk5Ua3pyOVJzSFU/view?usp=sharing)

Can you spot a few issues in the way the *facilitator* conducted the test?

<!-- 

	* Explained testers what the app is about, instead of asking them
	* Think out loud if you can
	* What is the point of this test?
	* Facebook tab open before you show the actual thing
	* If there's something important in the bottom-right corner of your screen, it would be better if it wasn't hidden in the final video
	
 -->

### Do's and dont's

You are the user-testing *facilitator*.

Your main job is to make your testers not feel stupid:

* state clearly that you're testing the the app, not them
* reassure them it's not their fault if what they do has an unexpected result
* encourage them to **think out loud**
* **no hints**, instead encourage them to think what they'd do if you weren't there
* be kind and **patient** 
* **don't take it personally** if they don't get what you think it's obvious, but try and understand why
* ask **specific questions**
* no orders, but rather give some choice to your testers (eg: *What would you click first?*)

### Your turn

1. Prepare a loose script for your user-testing session. You can take inspiration from this [sample script](https://hackpad.com/Sample-usertesting-script-UTHN25ekYIQ). Maybe copy that to Google docs?

2. Download and install [Silverback](http://silverbackapp.com)

	If it doesn't work, you can use PhotoBooth and QuickTime for screen recording.

	Windows users, let's work out together how to do this.

# Guinea pigs :)

We should have about 6 external guests that you kindly recruited.

Each user-testing session should last about 20 minutes, so you should get to test your project with 2-3 guests.

Make sure you ask them if it's ok to record their session, check all the [do's and dont's](#dos-and-donts)for user-testing and **take notes**!  



# Debrief 

What worked, what didnâ€™t, how to improve..



# Homework

Conduct and record another user-testing session using [Silverback](http://silverbackapp.com) (or, on a Mac: Photobooth + QuickTime screen recorder)

- [ ] Windows?
