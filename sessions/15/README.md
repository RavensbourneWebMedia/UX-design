# Formative

Here's the [collaborative feedback Google doc](https://docs.google.com/a/rave.ac.uk/document/d/1Vxqd9eODxFJagXYtjT7_Qum9SdgNj9mcSj_R0cmVFy4/edit?usp=sharing).

### WTF should we present?

A pitch presentation for your [*DAX*](../../projects/dax) concept:

* **What** is your idea?
* **Who** is it for?
* **Why** is it needed? What challenges (from a Museum's perspective) does it address?
* **How** does it work?
* What is your **plan** to develop it further?

The points above are the bare minimum of what your presentation should include. You're very welcome to present them in a different order and include any other aspects (such as your *inspirations*, your *creative process*, what you discovered in your *user testing*, etc.) which you consider relevant.

#### How long should the presentation be?

Ideally **10 minutes** (max 15 minutes) with another 5 for feedback and Q&A.

### Blog

#### Action plan!

1. Review the **formative feedback** your received.
* **Individually** jot down an *action plan*: list what you want to do in order to address that feedback (eg: `prototype alternative routes`, `try a different tone of voice`, `change the tutorial screen so that...`)
* **Compare** your action plan list with your team mates.
* Blog about this process, reflecting on the feedback received and how you (both individually and as a team) are responding to it.
