Formative presentations with Amy JB + Chris and Fabrice from NMM.

Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!


# Formative

Here's the [collaborative feedback Google doc](https://docs.google.com/a/rave.ac.uk/document/d/1Vxqd9eODxFJagXYtjT7_Qum9SdgNj9mcSj_R0cmVFy4/edit?usp=sharing).

### WTF should we present?

A pitch presentation for your [*DAX*](../../projects/dax) concept:

* **What** is your idea?
* **Who** is it for?
* **Why** is it needed? What challenges (from a Museum's perspective) does it address?
* **How** does it work?
* What is your **plan** to develop it further?

The points above are the bare minimum of what your presentation should include. You're very welcome to present them in a different order and include any other aspects (such as your *inspirations*, your *creative process*, what you discovered in your *user testing*, etc.) which you consider relevant.

#### How long should the presentation be?

Ideally **10 minutes** (max 15 minutes) with another 5 for feedback and Q&A.


# Homework

[izi.TRAVEL](https://izi.travel/en/app) is a storytelling and tour guide app for museums and cultural institutions. It's *free to download* and use for museum visitors, and it's also free for anyone to create content with.

Next week we'll have a guest from izi.TRAVEL, who'll give us tips on how to produce engaging content for museums. He'll then run a workshop with us, to create and test both indoor and outdoor guides.

In preparation for next week, three tasks for you:

### 1. Explore the izi.TRAVEL app

Download [the izi.TRAVEL app](https://izi.travel/en/app)

<!-- **Blind-test**: explore and observe! -->

Get comfortable with the app as a tourist. See what content exists and how you can consume it as a cultural tourist.

Write down your first impressions:

* How do you find the **onboarding process**? How does the app *welcome* you as a new user and show you what you can do with it?
* How is the **language** of the app's interface? What do the buttons say? 
* How is **content** presented? Compare a couple of tour guides, possibly from two different museums / institutions, and think about which one presents its collection in the most suitable way
* What **features** could be improved, and why?
* What features could be **added**, and why?

### 2. Sign up to the izi.TRAVEL CMS

Sign up as a content creator at [cms.izi.travel/registrations/new](https://cms.izi.travel/registrations/new):

* Use your `@students.rave.ac.uk` email. 
* In `Organisation` put `Ravensbourne`
* You'll get an email with a registration link, after you clicked it you'll be able to complete your registration.
* Make sure you put down your `Country` as `United Kingdom` and your `City` as `London` (you can leave the other fields blank).

### 3. Prepare some content for *your* tour

Next week we'll use izi.TRAVEL to make an **indoor tour** of the Maritime Museum. 

The **subject / theme** of your tour is up to you. It can be more or less related to your DAX project.

As a team, come prepared with the following: 

1. An introduction paragraph to your tour (short and sharp, think *elevator pitch*)
* A couple of images (you can grab them from Google)
* A map of the tour space (if available / relevant)
* A paragraph about the collection or group of exhibits you want to focus on
* 2-3 exhibit items with a short description and a couple of images per item. Items can be part of the Museum collection, or not (it could be something which is not in the Maritime Museum, but still relevant to your tour, e.g. the Cutty Sark).

### Blog

#### Action plan!

1. Review the **formative feedback** your received.
* **Individually** jot down an *action plan*: list what you want to do in order to address that feedback (eg: `prototype alternative routes`, `try a different tone of voice`, `change the tutorial screen so that...`)
* **Compare** your action plan list with your team mates.
* Blog about this process, reflecting on the feedback received and how you (both individually and as a team) are responding to it.
