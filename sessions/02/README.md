# UX research

- [ ] Feedback sheets

### Sketch your idea

To facilitate your interviews at the school, sketch out your idea.

The selling feature, doesn't have to be a wireframe.

Could be an illustration of a kid "talking" to their tablet

### Interviews

Goals:

* Get a general understanding of how kids use technology
* Gather feedback on your initial ideas

Your interviews will likely be split into two parts:

1. Getting to know the kids (3 key contextual questions)
* Key questions about your idea(s) / area(s) of interest (with drawings)

It may help to observe the kids use one of your *competitor apps*


# Homework

Hopefully after your interviews at the primary school you'll have a better idea of how kids use technology, and feedback on your initial concept(s). Yet sometimes ideas click after you speak to potential users, so between now and next week it'd be very useful to track down another child or two and **do another round of interviews**.

For these, you want to build on what you learned at the primary school, and dig deeper into your concept. 

Recruit a child: your little brother/sister, cousin, or your friend's little brother/sister etc.

You can conduct the interview via Skype/Facetime.
