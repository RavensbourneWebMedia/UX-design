# Amy Jackson-Bruce

* Former student at Rave's Web Media, currently *digital output coordinator* at Burberry.

* Job titles don't make sense (what does *digital output coordinator* even mean?)

* **Digital**: weird and wonderful things to enhance the shoppping experience. For instance, a chandellier made out of iPads (they tend to explode)

## User-testing

* User-testing on e-commerce platform: inform decisions about existing tools (what to tweak)

* What is user-testing?

	* representative sample of users (not your family/friends)
	* controlled environment (keep a distance and have a script)

* How do you know *your site is good*? Ie, how do you know you reached your (client's) goals?	

* People want to be nice to you, but that's not useful to user-testing. You want honest feedback, not pleasantry. 

### Why user-test?

* **Evidence** vs *speculation* (test your assumptions)

* **Who** are you designing for? Not for yourself / your circle of friends (remember homophily?)

* Different *mental models* (your understanding of a car, your own body, a search button..): do people understand the interfaces / tools you're designing? Will they use them as you intend?

* **Usability** vs **usefulness**: 100 useful features crammed into an app may not be usable..

* Test your language (aka *copy*), see [Ship your enemies glitter](http://shipyourenemiesglitter.com). Never use *lorem ipsum*. 

* Check if your **navigation labels** make sense.

* Uncover barriers and usability problems.

* Explore natural journeys 

### Types of user-testing

1. Lab testing

	Difference between what people do / want and what they *tell you* they would do / want

2. Tree testing

	Test your navigation, menus and copy

3. Remote testing

4. Beta testing

	Release an unfinished product to early adopters in exchange for feedback

5. User diaries

	People's feelings and opinions about a product. A bit like surveys, but over a period of time	

6. A / B testing

7. Card sorting

	Pile of cards (representing your navigation) and ask people to put them	into categories that will inform your navigation

### More effective to test 100 people or 10?

Counter-intuitively it's 10, because they can spot pretty much the same problems that 100 will spot.

### More effective to test 100 people once or 10 people twice?	

Testing as often as possible is more effective.


## Prototyping process

### The digital lip and nail bar

Nail varnish is problematic for customers to try out (difficult to remove, could stain your clothes..)

Conversation started with the beauty team (aka the *client*) to spec out requirements

Paper-prototyping interfaces and cardboard-prototyping objects. 

Rough prototypes ask people to fill in the gaps with their own imagination

Don't explain people what it is, let them try and watch what they do

User-testing can reshape your product requirements.. but don't just take in every request that people make

Scaling from prototype to beta to pilot to hundreds of units (and make sure they work)

Adding features to an existing product can be challenging. People are familiar with the existing product, get confused with new stuff

**User diaries**: assistants in store write every evening observations about the product, facilitated by a sort of Google Form. Questions about usability, and whether the business targets are achieved.

How do you **measure success**? Eg: purchases, difference in purchases, number of likes, are we making our money back. More on this here: [how to choose the right UX metrics for your product](http://www.gv.com/lib/how-to-choose-the-right-ux-metrics-for-your-product)
