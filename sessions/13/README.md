### Concept video

Concept videos allow you to tell a compelling story around your idea, even if you haven't built a prototype yet!

Did you know that Dropbox first MVP (*minimal viable product*) was [a concept video](https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/dropbox-minimal-viable-product/)? [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4eTR7tci6A).

You can capture interest with a vivid **problem description**, and convince people with a **backstory** or examples of how people will benefit from you concept.

Here are some more concept video examples:
 
* [Nupinion raised money on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/benjamingibert/nupinion-the-smart-news-toolbox-for-digital-citize), with a concept video as the centre piece of its crowdfunding campaign. 
* Another filter-bubbles-related project which successfully raised money on Kickstart is [Read Across the Aisle](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/72264020/read-across-the-aisle).
* [StartupVideos](http://startup-videos.com/) features loads of concept videos for you to get inspired, and [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) is another great source of concept video inspiration.

Using [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com) (free, online) **create a Minimum Viable Video for your Filter Bubbles concept!**

You may want your concept video to include some (or all) of these, in the order you feel is more appropriate:

- context
- problem
- solution
- features
- testimonials
- call to action

We'll review your MVV next week.

### Blog

Read [this guide](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/handbook/your_story) from Kickstarter on how to craft a compelling video (it starts with a compelling story). 

The blog about how you crafted your own concept video, and explain your choices (of story structure, imagery, tone, music etc.).
