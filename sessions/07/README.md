# User personas

### What are user personas?

A *user persona* is a UX design tool that allows you to visualise **users with common behavioural patterns** in their purchasing decisions, use of technology or products, customer service preferences, lifestyle choices, etc. 

Personas are **fictional** characters based on **real data** from user research.

### Why do we need personas?

To set a **common understanding** of the user(s) we're designing for. 

When you work on a product, instead of talking about a generic *elastic user* you can talk about *Chris* or *Danny*.

#### Personas as a design tool

As a **design tool** personas are used to answer key questions that will inform design decisions: 

* What would *Ali* do in this situation?
* What would she need now? 
* Does *Taylor* understand this?

You'll see how team discussions will be much more focused when you use personas, rather than a vague *elastic* user.

In order to be a **useful** design tool personas should **challenge** your design decisions, not simply validate them.

### Your turn

Each group: present your persona(s) to the class. We'll give you feedback (based on [personas dos and don'ts](../05#dos-and-donts)) and discuss how to use your personas in the next phase of your project.
