# Concept Video Review

Last week you were asked to make a concept video for your NMM Hidden histories project. 

This should have been in the form on an MVP, see last weeks Drop Box example below: 

Did you know that Dropbox first MVP (*minimal viable product*) was [a concept video](https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/dropbox-minimal-viable-product/)? [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4eTR7tci6A).

# Homework

### User-testing report!

An important and often overlooked part of user-testing is **collecting evidence** of your sessions, writing your **observations** and condensing them into a list of **actionable recommendations**.

<!-- Aggregating responses should take the form of simple tallies related to either task performance (success/failure) or sentiment (like/indifferent/dislike). -->

1. Open [this template GDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XIrJQe4acdR1fNuu53qgHxd80F5V_cvm2Uh62OQ3i1M/edit?usp=sharing). 
* `File` > `Make a copy...`
* Change the sharing settings for your copy so that `Anyone with the link can comment`.

	![](assets/gdoc-sharing.jpg)
* Share the link on Slack in the `#ux-design` channel. 
* Use this template as a guideline (not all sections in the template may apply to your project) to **write a report of your digital prototype user-testing**.

Bear in mind you'll be marked on this report (among other project materials, such as wireframes, presentations, prototypes etc). 

### Formative Assesment (round 2): Self Assessment 

We spoke last week about [self assessment](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/UX-design/tree/2018/sessions/06#intro-self-assessment-for-formative-on-5th-march-2018) and how this can benefit our understanding of how your learning will be measured. 

This week you will prepare a self assessment hand in as part of your formative submission.
