# User personas

### What are user personas?

A *user persona* is a UX design tool that allows you to visualise **users with common behavioural patterns** in their purchasing decisions, use of technology or products, customer service preferences, lifestyle choices, etc. 

Personas are **fictional** characters based on **real data** from user research.

### Why do we need personas?

To set a **common understanding** of the user(s) we're designing for. 

When you work on a product, instead of talking about a generic *elastic user* you can talk about *Chris* or *Danny*.

#### Personas as a design tool

As a **design tool** personas are used to answer key questions that will inform design decisions: 

* What would *Ali* do in this situation?
* What would she need now? 
* Does *Taylor* understand this?

You'll see how team discussions will be much more focused when you use personas, rather than a vague *elastic* user.

In order to be a **useful** design tool personas should **challenge** your design decisions, not simply validate them.

### Your turn

Each group: present your persona(s) to the class. We'll give you feedback (based on [personas dos and don'ts](../05#dos-and-donts)) and discuss how to use your personas in the next phase of your project.


# Workshop

### The design process

Remember the [**double diamond**](#http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-double-diamond)?

<!--
> In all creative processes a number of possible ideas are created (*divergent thinking*) before refining and narrowing down to the best idea (*convergent thinking*), and this can be represented by a diamond shape. 

We could split the **design process** in four stages. 
-->

### Where are you now?

<!-- At the start of the Develop phase -->

- [x] **Discover**
	
	* Competitor analysis	
	* User interviews
	
- [x] **Define**
	
	* Wireframes
	* User case(s)
	* User personas
	
- [ ] **Develop**
	
	* User stories
	* Prototype(s)
	
- [ ] **Deliver**
	
	...

### User stories

Not to be confused with [user cases / journeys](../04#use-case).

If a user case / journey is close to a comic, a user story fits more into a spreadsheet.

<!--
### Personas are not enough

Personas are useful to cluster different people into *archetypes* and summarise our user research.

Personas illustrate behaviours, attitudes, and motivations of people at a high level.

When **developing** our products we need **more detail** than what a persona tells us.
-->

### What are user stories then?

Plain English sentences that **describe the basic units of functionality** of your product.

Useful to:
 
* state **product features** without writing endless pages of documentation
* have a **checklist** for features development 
* get *everyone on the same page*
* not depended on the whims of a client / manager / focus group etc.

### As a `who?`, I want to `what?`, so that `why?` [`when`]

In just one sentence, a user story encapsulates

* **Who** is this functionality for?
* **What** does s/he want?
* **When** does s/he want it?  
* **Why** is it valuable to the her?

#### Examples

* As `an administrator`, I want to `search for my customers by their first and last names`, so that `I quickly find specific people to contact`.
* As `a user`, I want to `start the application with the last edit`.
* As `a user`, when `closing the application`, I want to `be prompted to save anything that has changed since the last save` so that `I don't lose work`.
* As `a student`, I want to `find my grades online` so that `I don't have to wait until the next day to know if I passed`.
* As `a book shopper`, I want to `read reviews of a selected book` to `help me decide whether to buy it`.
* As `an author`, I want `the spell checker to ignore words with numbers` so that `only truly misspelled words are indicated`.

### How do you write user stories?

1. Brainstorm and jot down **players** in the **system** (based on your personas), eg: visitor, potential customer, new customer, customer, system admin, content editor
* For each player, jot down **actions** s/he may want to do, eg: read about the service, get contact details, find info about opening times.. 
* For each action think about `before I do that, I need to` chains.
* Separate actions between **tasks** (intermediate in a chain) and **goals** (end of chain) 
* Map actions to players (one action could be assigned to more than one player)
* Write a user story for each action assigned to a player, from the player perspective.
* WHO and WHAT are required, WHY and WHEN are optional
* Organise actions that the system must / could / shouldn't allows players to do

### Your stories

1. Open [**this spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f8hT4n4rKA_vfWv2CXFFczrlBMhAPsxecoMOBBNny-o/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Duplicate the `_blank` sheet and give it your team name.
3. Jot down stories following the steps above.
