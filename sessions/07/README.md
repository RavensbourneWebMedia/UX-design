# Homework

### User-testing report!

An important and often overlooked part of user-testing is **collecting evidence** of your sessions, writing your **observations** and condensing them into a list of **actionable recommendations**.

<!-- Aggregating responses should take the form of simple tallies related to either task performance (success/failure) or sentiment (like/indifferent/dislike). -->

1. Open [this template GDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XIrJQe4acdR1fNuu53qgHxd80F5V_cvm2Uh62OQ3i1M/edit?usp=sharing). 
* `File` > `Make a copy...`
* Change the sharing settings for your copy so that `Anyone with the link can comment`.

* Share the link on Slack in the `#ux-design` channel. 
* Use this template as a guideline (not all sections in the template may apply to your project) to **write a report of your digital prototype user-testing**.

Bear in mind you'll be marked on this report (among other project materials, such as wireframes, presentations, prototypes etc).
