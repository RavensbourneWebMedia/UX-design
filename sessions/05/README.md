# Formative presentations

Here's the [collaborative feedback Google doc](https://docs.google.com/a/rave.ac.uk/document/d/1m6RAJLOg_OVvi8cEsnsTrLjYW0j0WufOxhd1aALnmt0/edit?usp=sharing).

### WTF should we present?

Your progress on [*Kidesign*](../../projects/kidesign) so far:

1. **What** is your idea?
* **Who** is it for?
* **Why** is it needed?
* What are the **key features**?
* Describe a **use case**. That is, illustrate from a **user's perspective** how they use a specific feature of your product.

The points above are the bare minimum of what your presentation should include. You're very welcome to present them in a different order and include any other aspects (such as your *creative process*, what you discovered in your *user interviews* and *user testing*, etc.) which you consider relevant.

### How long should our presentation be?

Ideally **10 minutes** (max 15 minutes) with another 5 for Q&A.

### Tips for the presenters

1. Don't start with an **apology**.   
  
	Whatever you have is what you'll present. 
* **Don't read** a script, or read from your presentation.   
  
	We can read ourselves.
* Don't be **defensive**.   
  
	We're not attacking you. 
	
	Instead of putting up a defence wall, try to listen for the feedback that can make your ideas better. 
* Be **confident**.   
  
	You know your work inside out, so speak about it with confidence.   
	
	Stand up and get your hands out of your pockets.
* Tell us a **story**, not a features list.  
  
	<!---->
* Ask **specific questions**.   
  
	Not `What do you think?` or `Do you like it?`. 
* **Smile**.   
  
	It makes people pay more attention, and it makes you sound more engaging. Simple :smile:

### Tips for everyone else

1. Be **kind**.   
  
	Your comments can be challenging, but make sure the creator of the work understands that your feedback is about their work, not about them.
* Be **constructive**.   
  
	Include *suggestions*, which the creator of the work can simply take away and use.   
  
	Also consider how you frame suggestions. Saying `Why didn't you make XYZ so and so?` may make the creator of the work feel like you think they're dumb or haven't done their work. Instead, try with `What do you think about making XYZ so and so?`
* Be **specific** and say **why**.   
  
	Rather than saying / writing `I don’t like XYZ` be specific about what you have an issue with, and why. Try saying / writing something like `I don’t think tXYZ reflects the user needs, because...`     
* **Focus on needs, not opinions**.
	
	Instead of a personal statement like `I hate the red button!` consider a user-focused question such as `Would users dislike the red button? It could be confused with an error message.`, which is much more effective, and also testable.

# Use cases

The term *use case* is a common source of misunderstanding because it is often used to mean different things. Sometimes people use it to describe:

* a stakeholder’s high-level goal
* a step by step description of system action
* the **flow of how users interact with a system**

As UX designers we usually mean the third kind.

A use case can be **textual**, **visual**, or both (usually both). You can think of it as a *comic* that illustrates how someone uses a specific feature of your product.

The use case is written from a **user's perspective** and describes the ideal interaction between a user and a system. 

If you are writing a use case for a leave request system, for example, you would title your use case *booking vacation days* instead of *decide to go on vacation* or *determine number of vacation days*. The user and the system would both be included in the use case as well as any additional people involved, such as a manager who has to approve the leave request.
