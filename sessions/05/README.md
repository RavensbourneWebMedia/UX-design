This afternoon you will present your work-in-progress at the NMM. 

Remember, this is a **formative presentation**, which gives you a chance to **get feedback** from the museum experts and **ask questions** to them. 

Talk about your **research**: what you learned from interviewing museum visitors, and what you observed at NMM and/or other museums.

Explain how your concept relates to the interests and needs of your **audience**.

You can use your elevator pitch, concept one-pager, experience map and prototype(s) to describe and visualise your idea.

**Make sure you have a few questions to ask to the museum experts**. They're not there to judge you, but to help you make design decision about your idea. Think about how you can you take advantage of their experience and knowledge. What could you ask them? What could they help you with?


# Homework

### Blog

1. Review the **formative feedback** your received.
2. **Individually** jot down an *action plan*: list what you want to do in order to address that feedback (eg: `prototype alternative game mechanics`, `try maps of obscure places`, `brainstorm different names`, `wireframe two options for the welcome screen`)
3. **Compare** your action plan list with your team mates.
4. Blog about this process, reflecting on the feedback received and how you (both individually and as a team) are responding to it.
