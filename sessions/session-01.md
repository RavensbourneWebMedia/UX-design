# What is UX?

* UX design is about effectively addressing the **needs** and **circumstances** of your **users**, to produce **interfaces** that are **comfortable** and even **joyful** to use.

* There are many definitions for User eXperience. [Here](http://www.allaboutux.org/ux-definitions) is a pool of definitions found from the literature and on the Web. We can start thinking about UX from this image

* **User-centred** approach (*user personas*) vs **activity-centred** approach (*user stories*). We'll do a bit of both.


## What is a prototype? How do we get there?

* Prototypes answer **questions** (the more specific the better).

* Prototypes stand between your ideas (**assumptions**) and your users (**behaviours**)

* Prototypes should be quick (and **cheap**) to make, re-make and possibly discard.

* Prototype should be **close** to the real thing

* We'll start with sketches on paper (**paper-prototypes**), and then move on to **HTML prototypes** (design in the browser)


## Why mobile-first?

* Embrace the **diversity** of devices people are accessing the Web from (2015 is *the* year mobile Web traffic will overtake *desktop* Web traffic, according to predictions that I should link to..)

* Starting from the small screens (and less capable hardware) makes you **focus** on what really matters

* Give yourself a **performance budget** (how much can this page weigh on a mobile phone? how long should it take to load on a 3G connection?)



# Come up with product ideas

1. Start by reading [Interfaces in need](https://medium.com/@gbks/interfaces-in-need-fa21105102c6) and [A guide to unsolicited redesigns](http://www.welcomebrand.co.uk/thoughts/the-designers-guide-to-unsolicited-redesigns/)

2. **Come up with (at least) 3 product ideas** and jot them down in [this collaborative Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvH4DzJyyMGLhlRfwow58k96xDwcw6ZX--RoUhqB928/edit?usp=sharing) (start today, refine by next week)

	* Jot down as many ideas as possible 
	* There are no *bad* ideas 
	* Put stray ideas to one side 
	* Don’t stay too long on one idea
	* Avoid multi-tasking (can you put your phone away for say 30 minutes?)


3. Form **pairs** and **discuss** your ideas with your partner.

	Some questions that may help each idea's scrutiny.

	* **Who** is this product for? 
	* Are **you** a (potential) user of this product? If yes, what's your experience of the product? What do you find **frustrating** about it?
	* What do you both think could be **improved**? 
	* Is there anything about this product you **disagree** on?
	* Could there be a *Third Approach*? That is, a new way of approaching the problem altogether? For instance, the iPhone wasn’t designed as *a better phone*, Google AdWords were not designed as *better banner ads* etc. 
	* What would {insert funny name here} **want** from this product? Put yourself in their shoes for a moment
	* *Swipe*. Can you **steal** ideas from another market and apply them to this product?
	* **Alternative Universe** Can you reverse one aspect of this product? What would happen?
	* Relentless questioning: **why**? Whatever your partner tells you about their idea, ask `why?` 
	

4. **Present** your *partner*'s idea (eg: Simeron presents Liam's idea)

	* You have about 2 minutes each
	* As the *product owner* you can chip in while your *partner* is presenting
	* Make sure you never say **But**. Instead, interrupt the other presenter with **Yes, and...**


## How do I generate ideas?

![](http://frankchimero.com/assets/ideas.gif)

If you want to have **good ideas** you must [have **many ideas**](https://medium.com/founder-stories/9bd554bedce0).

**Most** of them will be **wrong**, and what you have to learn is which ones to throw away. This is why we're asking you to come up with at least 3, so that one should be half-decent :)
