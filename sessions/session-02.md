* Analyse competitors
* Group exercise: play-acting Web products

Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#personifications)! 
	


# Learning goals review

1. Form **groups** of 3 people.

2. **Compare and review** your learning goals with your group. You can use the following questions ([taken from your blog assignment](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging/blob/master/what-are-my-learning-goals.md)) to guide your group discussion. 

	* What do you want to get out of this unit/project?
	* Why are these goals important to you?
	* Where do you currently stand?
	* Who do you admire? What can you learn from them?
	* How do you intend to achieve your goals?
	* How do you learn best? What hinders your learning?
	* Are your goals [SMART](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging/blob/master/what-are-my-learning-goals.md#smart-goals)?
	
3. **Present** each other's learning goals to the rest of the class.

4. Let's take a look at the [general learning goals](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204/blob/master/README.md#learning-goals) for this unit.



# Competitor analysis 

Before we start, [*fork* this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204/fork) and then *clone* it to your computah.

Pick 3 social networks and analyse them, using the template below.

Write it in *MarkDown*, then push it to your fork of this project on GitHub (inside the `students > {yourName}` folder).

### What networks should I pick?

You could start with social networks that you're familiar with and use regularly.

It may be a good idea to analyse social networks that are **competitors** to what you'll end up designing (competitors because of similar audience, similar content, similar actions etc.).

You can also consider quirky ones like [Ello](https://ello.co/), [Diaspora](https://joindiaspora.com/) and [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/about), or services that have a heavy social networking element like [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.co.uk).

## Social networks analysis template

### Social network 1

eg: [InstaBook](http://instabook.com), a social network for people sharing what they're currently reading?

### Social network 2

eg: [BorrowMyDinosaur](http://borrowmydinosaur.com), where people can lend their pet dinosaur to other members?

### Social network 3

eg: [myFace](http://myface.com), where people post selfies every morning?


### Audience(s)

Write your observations about the competitors' audience(s). Who is this network for, primarily and secondarily?

### Relationship(s)

What kind of relationships (aka *ties*) can users (aka *nodes*) establish in the network? 

What are the steps to connect (and disconnect)? What are these actions called (see *content definition* below)?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204/master/sessions/assets/social-network-graph.png)

#### Reciprocity

How do people *reciprocate* the relationships they establish on these networks? For example on Facebook you have to reciprocate (ie "I am your friend and you are my friend"), on Twitter you don't ("You follow me, but I don't follow you")

#### Homophily

To what extent do people form ties with similar versus dissimilar others? Similarity can be defined by gender, race, age, occupation, educational achievement, status, values, geographic proximity.. 

### Content(s)

What kind of content(s) are users producing, sharing and consuming on these networks?

What kind of comments do people post on these networks? As a designer, how can you *scaffold* users interactions around content.

Why are many comments on YouTube so moronic? Why do you think people let loose so much on that social network? [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx-WBaSNrTQ). It's funny.

### Currency

What do people *exchange* on the networks you chose?

For examples, `likes` are the currency on [Instagram](http://instagram.com), `retweets` and `followers` are [Twitter](https://twitter.com)'s currencies.

### Content definition

How are things called in your chosen social networks?

Is it `friends` or `contacts` or `buddies` or ... ?

Is it `like` or `love` or `appreciate` or `agree` or `+1` or ... ? 

And what implications could those choice of words have? For example, how do you `like` a post about a missing cat, or someone's death? Are all your connections really `friends`?

In particular, consider the **calls to action** (eg: `Buy this`, `Sign up today`, `Follow me`, `Send`, `Post` etc), which are usually found in buttons. What are your competitors asking users to do?

### Language

How do your competitors *talk* to their users, via texts and images?

Is the tone *formal* or *informal*, *plain* or *technical*, *sophisticated* or *unpretentious*, *active* or *passive*, etc.?

In what person do your competitors talk: `we`, `I`, `you`?

Is it `your profile` or `my profile`? 

What feelings do you think they are trying to trigger in the audience? 

### Onboarding

User *onboarding* is the process of increasing the likelihood that *new users* adopt your product and keep using it.

How do your chosen social networks onboard new users?

See these very good analyses of slightly confusing user onboarding: [Instagram](http://www.useronboard.com/how-instagram-onboards-new-users/) and [SnapChat](http://www.useronboard.com/how-snapchat-onboards-new-users/)

### Blank slate

> I just signed up, what do I do now?

Your app may feel without life and empty before the user has started to enter data into it. This is an opportunity to motivate the user to start using the app, by showing examples (sample content, screenshots) and best practices (seeds).

How do your chosen social networks deal with blank slates? How do they set the tone?

[More about blank slates here](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/BlankSlate).



# Play time!

What's a social network's **personality**?

1. Team up with one or two other people
2. Imagine a social network as a person, the **character** in a short **play** (2-3 minutes).
3. Choose one of the following scenarios (or invent one of your own!)

	* a dialogue between the personification of a social network and its user(s)
	* a dialogue between two users, mediated by the social network
	* a dialogue between two or more social networks. You can take inspiration from [this ads campaign](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0IEwkJ_-cc&list=PL8LyrHIAQqsely-o1aiJ6bakNtkV5t_zT)
	
4. You can use [this Google Doco](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUlogNpOp9q2N-NADW17y94h-4F0cpzWKh29opA30cw/edit?usp=sharing) to jot down your script	
Whilst the social network personification characters may be rather surreal, bizarre or allegorical, it's useful to base your user characters on **real people**, people that you know personally (but not yourself).

Think about a specific situation, a *task* that your user character needs to get done.



# Homework

### From last week

Also, if you haven't done / published the post from last week yet (the one about [your learning goals for this unit](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging/blob/master/what-are-my-learning-goals.md)), please push it to your fork of this project on GitHub (inside the `students > {yourName}` folder). Ideally as a MD file, because we don't like MS Word :)

### Personifications

Imagine a social network as a person, the character in a short play (2-3 minutes). Write the script for it.

This can be a spin-off of the story you came up with in class, or a completely new story.

Write it in MarkDown, then push it to your fork of this project on GitHub (inside the `students > {yourName}` folder).

You [can take a look at what last year's students came up with](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/74gwwgn735e3wyh/AADV7X2pAXL7Ns2bRpXk0QWXa?dl=0#/) (bear in mind that their project brief was different, yours is specifically about social networks)

Next session we'll pick a few scripts and act them out!
