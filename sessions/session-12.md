Engine: lots of UX research for clients-->

# What is service design?

> Design is about making something **better** for someone. 

Better, as in more.. 

* useful
* usable
* desirable
* efficient
* effective
* meaningful
* valuable
* sustainable

Service types:

1. Customer service (help desk)
2. Software applications (BBC news, Facebook)
3. Software as a service (Google Drive)
4. Service as a product
5. Product/service systems

> **Service** is the act of helping someone to do something.

Service Design is the process of inventing or improving experiences that happen across multiple **touch points** over time.

[Touch point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpoint): anything from a service that a customer gets to *touch*, ie interact with, eg: website, help desk, points of sale.

Advertising can be considered an *awareness touchpoint*.



# Customer research

1. Know what you have to find out. What are the actual problems that customers are having?
2. Know your offer
3. Know your audience
4. Know your tool/methods
5. Design your testing (for your idea, wireframes, prototypes, app..)
6. Recruit and prepare your research materials


### **Discover** > define > develop > deliver (+ disrupt)

## Discovery

Understanding what we're going to do
Develop insights on the customer's world in their own product and service areas to inform and inspire design
Market + customer research

1. Understand needs and values for customers
* Understand the context
* Identify challenges, drivers and hurdles
* Understand the system of delivery
* Identify opportunities (sweet spots), needs and solutions



#### Benchmarking

**Comparing competitors** and ranking them based on criteria like product desirability, accessibility, design, price etc. 

You pick competitors based on your initial understanding of your customer base.

To gather information: 
* Expert reviews (articles online or magazines)
* Customer reviews on forums
* Design review with UX/UI designers
* User testing (if you have an actual prototype or app to use)

It's crucial to develop a **framework to analyse and compare competitors**, otherwise we're throwing bullshit around.

> The most important question to ask is: why?

### Customer interviews

#### Expert interview

Access a wealth of in-depth and/or process and technical information.

Think about which areas of expertise are relevant to your brief and approach the experts that could help you answer your research questions, or put you in touch with customers.

#### Interviews in home

Go to their place, spot issues, ask questions.. you pick up things that they won't tell you about.

Have a clear discussion guide for your interview.

#### Interview in context

How do they communicate with other people.

Observe and talk to people.

Have a clear discussion guide for your interview.

Not just the obvious people, find also other people that customers hang out with.

#### Field interviews and shadowing


## Interviewing tips

* Keep it simple. Explain what you're doing.

* You're interested in them as people, not just as users

* Be respectful

* Smile

* Have an incentive (eg: iTunes vouchers, cash, merchandise, a coffee)

* Have a media permissions sheet.

## Writing guides tips

**Guide not script**: let the conversation flow, steer it gently.

**Themes**: identify 4-6 themes around which to structure your session, questions or tasks

**Actions speak louder than words**: observation and gather evidence is key. 

**Show not just tell**: ask them to show you things, not just blabber

**How**: ask how they do stuff

**Why**: ask why they do it

**Use examples** to help people understand the type of answer you are after

**Comparisons**

**Open questions**

**Help participants tell their stories**, what happened before and after. And what would have happened if...


### Journals

Could be a blog, or a booklet. 

Good to capture things over time, understand each step of a product journey.



### Affinity and sorting analysis

Emerging themes

### Design context map

Context > causes > problems

<!--### Customer's world-->



### Personas

Aggregation of people's traits from interviews or observation.

1. What I do
* What I want
* What I need
* I use social networks to...
* What I will respond to

### Customer journey mapping

Tracking and describing all experiences customer has as they encounter a service / product.

Identify *moments of truth*, *seams and baton changes*

Reveal dependencies

Identify actions and owners

Highlights **pain points** and gaps in the customer experience.

### Speed rating

Ask people to rate features


## Design principles 

For example:

* Always allow people to discover (what you may like, what your friends watch, something completely new)

> Principles about the interface, but what are your design principles in relation to the concept of your app?

* The way content is presented to you is such and such
* Make things seamless, without users putting a lot of effort into it

On average 5, and everything you design should try and match these principles.

Step back from the wireframes and think about: is your idea the right thing to do?


# Issue mapping

1. What is the issue you're trying to solve?
2. What are the causes of that?
3. What's the context?






























# Assignments

### 1. Document your issue map

* What is the main **issue** you're working on? 
* What are its **causes**? 
* What is its **context**?

Take a picture of your initial thoughts on the paper framework provided by Itamar, then elaborate on these thoughts digitally (MarkDown recommended, blog post welcome, don't assume people bought/use MS Word):

* What are the gaps in your current understanding of the issue?
* What are the gaps in your understanding of your target audience(s)?
* How do you plan to *fill* those gaps through research?

Push everything to your folder on GitHub.

### 2. Plan interviews and testing

Based on the conclusions of your issue map (see above), start recruiting people for interviews, user-testing or both.

Find people that are potential users of your social network, and possibly not your mum / dad / brother / sister / boyfriend / girlfriend.

More on interviewing [here](session-03.md#good-practices-for-user-research) and [here](https://medium.com/research-things/interviewing-humans-fa198f809c40)

Your interview / user-testing must be scheduled **before the 19th of May**. Don't leave it till last minute.

Bear in mind that a [big chunk of your mark](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/UX-design#components) will be based on your research (of which interviews are part) and iteration (of which user-testing is part of)
