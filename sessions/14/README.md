### A/B testing

Split Testing, or A/B testing, is a randomised experiment with two variants, A and B, which are the control and treatment in the controlled experiment

You can use them to make almost any decision: from design decisions, to pricing.

Independent design studio Upwell, goes undercover to test the validity of their new product by using IKEA as their testing ground.
IKEA is the perfect retail research lab. They have an ideal demographic and amazing consumer exposure for Upwells new product, Walhub. Upwell created IKEA-esque visuals - product tags and UPC barcodes as to not bias their experiment, and even went so far as to dress up as an IKEA employee in order to install Walhub without raising too much suspicion… They set up mics and cameras to record the experience and more importantly the consumer feedback….
