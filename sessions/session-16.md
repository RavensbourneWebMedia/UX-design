# User-testing debate

Aka **debrief**. 

First in small groups (2-3 people) and then all together.

Thinking about last week's user-testing session:
 
* What **worked**?
* What could be **improved**? What would you change if you were to go back in time?
* Things you **wish** you would have done during, before or after the session
* **Tricks** you learned (and are going to use in your next user-testing session)
* How did use your **script** as you tested with different people? Did you *improvise*?
* What **reactions** did your questions trigger? Did you try different ways of asking the same question? Did you ask people *preliminary* questions (at the beginning of the session)?
* What role did **video-recording** the session play for you? How did people react to being filmed?  
* Did you take **notes**? Why?

Write down you group observations on post-its and we'll then discuss them all together.

# Reality check 

Thinking about the feedback you received from your *guinea pigs*:

* What *patterns* emerged? Ie were there parts of your interface or communication which more than one person found problematic?
* What changes are you going to make to your project as a result of user-testing?
