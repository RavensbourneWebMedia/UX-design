# User-testing debate

Aka **debrief**. 

First in small groups (2-3 people) and then all together.

Thinking about last week's user-testing session:
 
* What worked?
* What could be improved?
* Things you wish you knew beforehand
* Techniques / tricks you learned (and are going to use in your next user-testing session)
* How did your script change as you tested with different people?
* What reactions did your questions trigger? Did you try different ways of asking the same questions?

<!--![]()-->

Write down you group observations on post-its and we'll then discuss them all together.

# Reality check 

Thinking about the feedback you received from your *guinea pigs*:

* What *patterns* emerged? Ie were there parts of your interface or communication which more than one person found problematic?
* What changes are you going to make to your project as a result of user-testing?


Sign up to [Trello](https://trello.com/) and write down a list of things that need doing in your project.
