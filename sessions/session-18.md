# Session 18	

### Today, Thursday 4th June 2015

Summative assessment, aka *presentations*!


# Tips

### For the presenter

1. Don't start with an **apology**.   
  
	Whatever you have is what you'll present. 
* **Don't read** a script, or read from your presentation.   
  
	We can read ourselves.
* Don't be **defensive**.   
  
	We're not attacking you. 
	
	Instead of putting up a defence wall, try to listen for the feedback that can make your ideas better. 
* Be **confident**.   
  
	You know your work inside out, so speak about it with confidence.   
	
	Stand up and get your hands out of your pockets.
* Tell us a **story**, not a features list.  
  
	<!---->
* Ask **specific questions**.   
  
	Not `What do you think?` or `Do you like it?`. 
* **Smile**.   
  
	It makes people pay more attention, and it makes you sound more engaging. Simple :smile:

<!--
* Don't try to **please me**.   
  
	Our ideas may be different and I respect that. Your job is to show the value of your work, not to flatter me. 
-->

### For everyone else

1. Be **kind**.   
  
	Your comments can be challenging, but make sure the creator of the work understands that your feedback is about their work, not about them.
* Be **constructive**.   
  
	Include *suggestions*, which the creator of the work can simply take away and use.   
  
	Also consider how you frame suggestions. Saying `Why didn't make XYZ so and so?` may make the creator of the work feel like you think they're dumb or haven't done their work. Instead, try with `What do you think about making XYZ so and so?`
* Be **specific** and say **why**.   
  
	Rather than saying / writing `I don’t like XYZ` be specific about what you have an issue with, and why. Try saying / writing something like `I don’t think tXYZ reflects the user needs, because...`     
* **Focus on needs, not opinions**.
	
	Instead of a personal statement like `I hate the red button!` consider a user-focused question such as `Would users dislike the red button because it could be confused with an error message?`, which is much more effective, and also testable.




# Feedback spreadsheet

[This is the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1obz1D_ORgucj6ei3nIYDcFOxfAKhSDyM3jqQ7SuFGEw/edit?usp=sharing) where we all give each other feedback.




# Hand-in checklist

Your project [hand-in package](#hand-in-package) should include the following (from the [project components](../README.md#components) list):

1. **Research** identifying problems and opportunities through [competitor analysis](session-02.md#competitor-analysis), examining audiences through [user interviews](session-03.md#user-interviews), understanding [behaviours](session-14.md#designing-behaviours) and interpreting your research data through [user personas](session-04.md#user-personas) 
* **Experimentation** exploring ideas through [wireframes](session-05.md#wireframing) and [user journeys](session-06.md#user-journeys), from paper to digital
* **Iteration** [prototyping](session-13.md#rapid-prototyping) and [user-testing](session-15.md#user-testing-preparation) your concepts (both [remotely](session-07.md#usability-testing) and [face2face](session-15.md#let-them-in-))
* **Communication** writing [motivational copy](session-10.md#your-turn) for [emails](session-11.md#engagement-email) and [Web interfaces](session-10.md#2-hack-your-interface-copy), formalising your project requirements through [user stories](session-13.md#your-stories), presenting both your project's output and process  

### Prototypes

Your prototypes should have **~30 states**. 
		
For example: a login screen *could* have a default state, a state with text filled in, and a state for the "uh-oh that doesn't seem to be the right password" state. 

If you used Invision, you must include a link to your clickable prototype (copy the *share* link) in your hand-in package.

If you used Muse, your prototype must be accessible on the Web. Upload it to your raveweb.net subdomain, or to your own Web hosting space, and then include a link to it in your hand-in package.

You don't need to include your prototype source files (Photoshop / Illustrator / etc) in your hand-in package, but you can if you want to.

### Presentations

Include your formative and summative presentations in your hand-in package.

### File size restrictions on GitHub

GitHub doesn't allow you to store files larger than 50MB. 

You can store those on Google Drive or Dropbox (or any other bulk-storage service). 

Any large file that you consider important for us to review when marking your projects (for example, your user-testing videos) must be accessible on the Web. Include a link to it in your hand-in package.	

### Hand-in package

1. Make sure your files and folders are named sensibly. That is, no `Hand in` or `Archive` or `Project` or any other similarly anonymous and/or generic names. Good examples: `User interviews`, `Wireframes` and `home-logged-in.jpg`
* *Push* your project work to GitHub. See file size restrictions above.
* Create a new folder and name it like so: `COURSECODE-Name-Surname`, for example `WEB12345-Matteo-Menapace`.
* In that folder, add a **`README.md`** file listing all the links to your project work
	* GitHub repo
	* Dropbox / Google Drive bulk files (for videos from user-testing, presentations..)
	* Prototype links (Invision / Muse)
	* ..any other links that you consider relevant and can improve your grade
* Create a **zip archive** for that folder. It should keep the `COURSECODE-Name-Surname` naming convention, for example `WEB12345-Matteo-Menapace.zip`
* Upload the zip archive to Moodle.
