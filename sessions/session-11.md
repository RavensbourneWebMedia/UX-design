# Communities

Watch [Community (the TV series)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_%28TV_series%29)

[HotBot](http://www.hotbot.com/) was the search engine before Google became hot

Technologies change, communities are still there: it's about **people**

### Takeways

1. What is a community manager? (and how do you explain it to your parents)
2. Benefits of community management 
3. How to develop a community plan (focus on people)

# What is a community manager?

Not just a social media manager. Social media is a tool.

1. Strategy (a plan to develop a community)
2. Growth
3. Content (seeding)
4. Moderation: steering the vibe (sometimes users run away with their own excitement, pushing the boundaries of what's acceptable)
5. **Events**: meet people face to face
6. Relationships and influence: reach out the right people
7. User experience: acting on community feedback, talking to people, digging on stats
8. Business integration: front-line engaging with users, to inform business decisions

### Code Club

Volunteers from the tech communities into schools to teach children coding. Like a dating agency for people who want to share their knowledge and skills, which matches you by postcode.

1400 volunteers, about 1000 teachers

Small communities can feel huge.

### Made in Leigh

Makers in Essex, small but thriving community

### Toast Masters

Learning public speaking, listening effectively and giving feedback.

# My communities

List all the communities you feel part of, both those you *consume* and those who you *contribute* to.

Consuming is not a negative thing, most times you start as a *lurker* before you contribute.

### Benefits for you

* **exposure** eg *people get to listen to my music*
* **knowledge** eg *I learn new stuff*
* **skills** 
* **discovery**
* **belonging** especially for communities of circumstance
* **enhancing** your life by sharing your geekiness with like-minded people
* **feedback** from people about your ideas, products etc
* **status**
* **platform** to try things out

### Benefits for organisation

* **knowledge base**
* **free workers**
* **efficiency**
* **personality**, ie branding
* **mobilise** people
* **leads** more potential customers
* **money** (Return of Investment)
* **word of mouth** referrals, get people talking about the organisation
* members become your **ambassadors**
* engage the community in early **product development**
* find **gaps** in the market

### More benefits, more engagement

Iterative cycle: use the community to constantly improve your product.

Feedback loop: observation, experimentation, conversation, back to the drawing board

How do you increase engagement, and user base?

1. Incentives (shouldn't be the only reason for people to join)
2. Status
3. Regular content
4. Rewards
5. Opportunity to contribute
6. Provide the hook
7. Competitions

# Users vs people

Avatars vs human beings.

You need to think of your community as people, not numbers.

### If you build it they will come

You can't reproduce *traction*

Start small and then scale


# Community planning exercise

Create a document and flesh out the following:

1. Community **type** (action / interest / place / practice / circumstance)
2. **Who** is it for (typical users? age / location / gender)
3. **Objective** (what is the community trying to achieve?)
4. Key **influencers** (fame / influence / power / expertise / evangelists / hyperconnected people) 
	someone that you can email with some confidence they will reply, not an A-listed celebrity
	(eg: @mberry leading expert on computing for primary schools)
5. Seed **questions and topics** (open questions that encourage conversation)
6. **Value** to members, eg perks, content, promotion, kudos, status, support, networking opportunities, entertainment

# Social network vs forum

Forum is? 

* based around content
* people talk about subjects

Social network is?

* closed
* topic is people
* relationships are more important than subjects
* *this is who I am*


Is hard to win an audience with a broad topic. Need to be niche. How can you compete with SoundCloud

You can't compete on traction (pull users away). You better compete on specific content. 

> What is your project unique, differentiating feature?

# Conflict

Can be good (eg Guardian comments)

Your role is to **steer** the conversation and set the **tone**, care for the people who are part of the community

# RoI

Strictly it can be considered as financial.

Measuring:

* visitors
* registered members
* participants
* regulars
* volunteers

Linking reporting with activities you are making (eg an event you organised which created a spike in signups)


# Channels

Which is the best communication channel? The one your users are on.

Don't underestimate email. Great tool for engagement

Monitor all your communication with [Intercom](http://intercom.io)

# Engagement exercise

Write a short introduction email to a new member of your community.

1. Encourage participation
2. Sound genuine
3. AND not be generic

> Thank you for you precipitation


# Assignments
