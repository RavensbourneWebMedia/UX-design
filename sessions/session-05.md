# Session 5	

## Today, Tuesday 3rd February 2015

1. Interviews review
* User personas 
* Interface design patterns
* Paper-prototyping 
* Wireframing: sketch many interfaces on paper, trying out different solutions.



# Interviews review

* Take 5 minute to write 4-5 important observations (on post-its notes) about what people said.
* What are the **common themes** you see emerge?
* What are the **common problems** you heard or observed?
* Did any of the findings make you start to think differently about your community and the problems you may have already been designing for?



# User personas

See [session 4](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14204/blob/master/sessions/session-04.md#user-personas)

<!-- We had to re-jig things around because of timetable changes-->



# Interface design patterns

### What is a [design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design_pattern)? 

It is a formal way of documenting a solution to a common design problem. The idea started in architecture in the late 70s, and has since been extended to software engineering, interaction design, and various other fields.

### Webdesign patterns

Webdesign patterns are a way to describe solutions to common problems and challenges in a Web-specific context. They document interaction models and layout structures that make it easier for users to understand an interface and accomplish their tasks.

Let's look at some patterns from [GoodUI](http://goodui.org)

## Your turn

Now think of the website you're (re)designing and list a few patterns that you consider using in your project. 

Go to http://goodui.org and pick at least two patterns that you want to use in your design. Explain why the chosen patterns are relevant

Is *this* a wireframe?

Wireframes are about communicating your ideas.

They are about **content**, **context** and **interaction**. Use real content, not *lorem ipsum*. 

They're not about style. When wireframing, don't worry about colours, graphics and typography. 

### Leading questions

When wireframing you should ask yourself:

* What content is going to be on this page?
* How is the content organised on this page?
* Which content is most important on this page?
* Where users will go from this page?
* Where is this page on the site?
* How will users move around the site (navigation)?

[Will Evans](https://twitter.com/semanticwill) defines wireframes as a *thinking device for the setting and exploration of a given problem space*. 

### Three phases

Wireframes are very useful throughout the design process:

1. **Divergence** 

	You're **exploring** alternatives, not looking for defined solutions at this point. 

	The first round of wireframes provide a space to engage in a **dialogue** with other designers, clients, and the wireframes themselves.

	Don't make only one wireframe, only one version of a page. Make many, explore different alternatives for the same goal(s).

 	Don't be precious. **Sketch solutions on paper**, explore alternatives quickly, and if necessary discard them.

2. **Transformation**

	Toss out the bad ideas, start to understand better the more complex requirements of a project.

	Focus on the **content** of each page. 
	
	Interface design is copywriting, every word matters. 

	Use real content, not *lorem ipsum*. 

	If at this point you have no real content, stop wireframing and get it, or ask for it.

	Use **annotations** to empower the wireframe with important information and links to research, conversations, requirements, missing information, missing content, questions etc

3. **Convergence**

	Focus on one solution, **flesh it out** and discuss it with people from your target audience (possibly different user roles), members of your team (other designers, developers etc) and clients. 

	At this point you may want to move away from paper and wireframe with a tool that allow you to tweak more easily.



# Assignments

### 1. Wireframe 

Sketch out at least 5 key screens / states of your social network.

Let's not start from the *homepage*.

You can either wireframe on paper or digitally.

#### Paper wireframes

Print out wireframing templates from [InterfaceSketch](http://www.interfacesketch.com)

![](http://www.interfacesketch.com/previews/web-browser-template.png)

Or..

#### Digital wireframes

Use [Moqups](http://moqups.com) or [InVision](http://www.invisionapp.com)


### 2. Read and comment this article

[Make it like the PSD](http://dangovan.com/make-it-like-the-psd)

Key questions that may guide your blog post (in no particular order):

* What are the disadvantages of presenting Photoshop documents, as opposed to other ways of communicating a design (according to the author)?
* If PSDs are so bad, why do so many people use them as *project deliverables*?
* What alternatives does the author propose to the *Photoshop-driven design process*?
* How do you feel about the *Photoshop-driven design process*?
