# Once upon a time...

It feels like last term was ages ago. Let's grab some post-its and write down what went well and what we could improve on. 

Some aspects to consider:

* Collaborating with institutions like NMM
* Working in teams
* Work-load
* UX design methods
* Blogging

<!--
### What went well
### Even better if
-->

After we've collected and discussed all your inputs, we'll discuss your learning goals for this term.

## This term

We'll be **collaborating** with [Stationers Crown Wood Academy](http://scwa.org.uk). 

The collaboration broad theme is *digital citizenship* and we'll be focusing on **[filter bubbles](../../projects/filter-bubbles)**. Your **individual brief** for this term will be to design and prototype a *digital object* that helps people become aware of their filter bubbles and/or burst them.

Throughout the project you'll be interacting with minors (the SCWA students) so we need to do a very short training on dos and don'ts, led by Lucy Slater from the Outreach department. It's mostly common sense.

# Workshop

Our special guest for today is [Valentina D'Efilippo](http://www.valentinadefilippo.co.uk/), information designer, educator and author of [The Infographic History of the World](http://www.valentinadefilippo.co.uk/projects/the-infographic-history-of-the-world/)

Valentina will talk about her experience and introduce you to **data visualisation** through practical exercises:

* data in your bag
* map your personal data

Throughout the day you'll have a chance to get to know the SCWA students.

# Project kickstart

Watch [this TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?language=en#t-53082) in which Eli Pariser introduces **filter bubbles** and explains the danger they pose.

Start mapping your own filter bubbles.

Then compare them with those of at least two of your classmates.

See an example from a couple of past students.

<!--
Individually, write about Filter Bubbles. Reflect on the concept and document your thought process. You can post pictures of scribbled notes, or jot down notes digitally. It doesn't need to be fleshed out and well written. The main goal here is to record your flow of ideas, not to make it beautiful!

Ideally we'd get a variety of responses, from projects that raise awareness about certain aspects of digital citizenship, to others that get people active in protecting their data or changing their data consumption habits.

# Homework

* Continue mapping your filter bubbles
* Survey for NMM
* Install data-selfie

### Blog

Read and blog about [data selfies](https://policyreview.info/articles/news/speculative-data-selfies/449)

Some points for your reflection:

* What is your online identity, your digital footprint?
* How is your identity online different from your IRL one?
