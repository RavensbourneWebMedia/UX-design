# Week 9

### Today, Thursday 3rd March 2016

User-test your digital prototypes with school children (and potentially teachers).

Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!


# User-testing

You have user-tested your **ideas** and **paper-wireframes** last month. 

Now it's time to user-test your **digital prototypes**. 

<!--At this point you should be testing details, rather than the *bigger picture*.-->

1. Put your prototype in front of your testers and see if they *get it* without clicking on anything. Is your idea clear enough at a first glance?
* Give them a few tasks to do on your prototype and see how they perform them. This is usually the bulk of a user-testing session.
* Finally, ask if they have any more questions, or suggestions.

#### Do's and dont's

You are the user-testing **facilitator**.

Your main job is to make your testers not feel stupid:

1. State clearly that you're testing the the *thing*, **not them**.
* Reassure them it's not their fault if what they do has an unexpected result.
* Encourage them to **think out loud**.
* **No hints**, instead encourage them to think what they'd do if you weren't there. Ask them what they are thinking or looking for but avoid words like `try`.
* Be kind and **patient**, don't sigh. 
* **Don't take it personally** if they don't get what you think it's obvious, but try and understand why.
* You should look out for **friction points**: those moments when the user stops concentrating on her tasks and starts thinking about the tool and how she is going to use it. Note questioning words, especially where testers question their own judgement, `why can't I find...`, `I expected to see...` etc. as this indicates that the workflow for the task may have broken down.
* **No orders**, but rather give some choice to your testers (eg: *What would you click first?*)
* Allow people to proceed in a task until you don't feel like it's producing any value or they becomes very frustrated.

> The best kind of user test is one where the subject is not influenced by too much direction, they are simply there to use what's in front of them to achieve a goal that you set out before the test began.

# Homework

### User-testing report!

An important and often overlooked part of user-testing is **collecting evidence** of your sessions, writing your **observations** and condensing them into a list of **actionable recommendations**.

<!-- Aggregating responses should take the form of simple tallies related to either task performance (success/failure) or sentiment (like/indifferent/dislike). -->

1. Open [this template GDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XIrJQe4acdR1fNuu53qgHxd80F5V_cvm2Uh62OQ3i1M/edit?usp=sharing). 
* `File` > `Make a copy...`
* Change the sharing settings for your copy so that `Anyone with the link can comment`.

	![](assets/gdoc-sharing.jpg)
* Share the link on Slack in the `#ux-design` channel. 
* Use this template as a guideline (not all sections in the template may apply to your project) to **write a report of your digital prototype user-testing**.

Bear in mind you'll be marked on this report (among other project materials, such as wireframes, presentations, prototypes etc). 

You will be able to change your report after next week and until the final hand-in in June, however the sooner you write it the better, as your user-testing sessions will be fresher in your memory :)
