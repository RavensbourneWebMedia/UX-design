# User personas

### Once upon a time...

Personas started as a **marketing tool**, designed by Angus Jenkinson to categorise customers beyond the traditional *segmentation* based on demographic categories. You can [read his paper here](http://www.centreforintegratedmarketing.com/gfx/documents/beyond_segmentation.pdf): from *classes* or *clans* to individuals that flock together based on *common characteristics*. Remember [homophily](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily)?

Alan Cooper introduced *user personas* as a methodology to solve the ***elastic user problem***. He claimed that using *the user* as a design tool is a mistake. The vagueness of *the user* causes many design failures, as *the user* is too *elastic*. We therefore need something much more specific: *user personas*.

## What are user personas?

A persona represents a **cluster of users** who exhibit similar behavioural patterns in their purchasing decisions, use of technology or products, customer service preferences, lifestyle choices, etc. 

**Behaviours**, **attitudes**, and **motivations** are common to a type of user (sometimes called an *archetype*) regardless of age, gender, education, and other typical demographics. 

Personas are **fictional** characters. Even so, they are (or should) based on **real data** and user research: interviews, focus groups, surveys etc.

<!--Personas are **archetypes** built to identify potential users: what they **need**, **want** and **expect** from what we are designing.

An *archetype* is a pattern of behaviours that help us s you better understand yourself and others.

In UCD the personas are created based in a previous research, but in Lean UX methods for example, personas are created originally based on assumptions (*proto-personas*) in a brainstorming session with the team, and further checked against actual real data (See  Gothelf, Jeff. Lean UX. Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience. 2013).

Personas must answers three basic questions: what are the user needs, wants and limitations.-->

### What are user personas NOT?

A persona is not a demographic profile, a market segment or a report of survey data. 

It is not taking what people tell you directly, it’s looking at their behaviours in order to understand the *whys* and build around them. Observation is key, because what people do and say can be entirely different things.

Homer thinks that *everyman* wants this car.

### Why do we need personas?

To set a **common understanding** of the final user(s). 

When you work on a product (either alone or more commonly in teams), instead of talking about a generic (elastic) *user*, you can talk about *Chris*, or *Danny* (or whatever you decide to call your personas).

As a **design tool** personas are used for answers key questions that will inform design decisions: 

* What would `personaName` do in this situation?
* What would she need now? 
* Does `personaName` understand this?

In order to answer such questions usefully and help you make effective design decisions, your personas should be specific and based on real data (more on this below).


## Dos and Don'ts

`+` Do base your personas on **real data**: people that you know or have interviewed / surveyed.

`-` Don't make your personas entirely **fictional**. Your product is going to be used by real people, not fairytale characters that unquestioningly adopt it and happily use it ever after.

`-` Don't make your personas perfectly match the ***ideal** user* of what you're designing. I call these ***delusional** personas*. Personas should challenge your design decisions, not simply mirror them.

`-` Don't create user personas in your *own image*. It's easy (and tempting) to create personas who are in their early 20s, living in London and studying design or working in a creative agency in Shoreditch.. but there's life beyond our **homophilic bubbles**.

`-` Don't **oversimplify** your personas: real people are complex, not shallow and generic.

`+` Do rather go for the **extreme cases**, and the middle will take care of itself. For example: design for older people, or for people that are not familiar with the internet, etc.

`+` Do base your personas on needs, goals, and dimensions that have a direct impact on their interaction with the product you're designing.

`-` Don't worry about demographic detail: just enough to help us get to know this persona. For example *Ben, 46, father of a girl and a primary school teacher*

`+` Do focus on **causality**: what are the reasons your personas behave in a certain way? What drives them in their choices?

<!--### How to build personas-->

The example above is a design persona for a short-term loan company. Its author Ryan van der Merwe writes:

> The key to these types of personas are the **dimensions**, or in this particular case, the **loan drivers**. Note that for Monde, the monthly instalment is not important. What’s important is that she gets the amount she needs to pay for her travel. For the persona that just wants a TV or some new shoes, this is different. For that persona the amount is less important — what’s most important is whether or not they can afford the monthly instalment.

## Your turn

Create (at least) two user personas for your online social network, using the guidelines above.

How you structure your personas (in terms of contents and visual presentation) is up to you. 
If you desperately need a template, you could [use this as a starting point](http://www.ux-lady.com/diy-user-personas/) (but please, don't just mindlessly copy it).

If you have interviewed people already, then you can base your personas on them. Otherwise you can create *proto-personas* based on your assumptions and understanding of what real people do/want/need (and refine them after you've interviewed real people).


<!--**Marketing personas** (demographics, habits) vs **design personas** (focused on needs, goals, and dimensions that have a direct impact on their interaction with a website). More on that [here](http://www.elezea.com/2013/12/job-stories-and-personas-sitting-in-a-tree)

Personas can sometimes be oversimplified caricatures of users that don’t take specific situations and actions in consideration. It's better to be specific than shallow and generic: go for the extreme cases, and the middle will take care of itself (eg: design for older people, or for people that are not familiar with the internet, etc).-->
