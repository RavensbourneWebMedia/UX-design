# Formative 2 prep

### WTF should we present?

Does your **pitch** presentation react to the [NMM hidden histories Brief](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/UX-design/tree/2018/projects/nmm_hidden_histories)? Let's look this over. 

As a pitch, you want to focus on the **solution** your product provides to a **problem** for your target **users** (less on the process). 

It's about how people use your product and how they need it to make their experience better.

> Talk about them, not yourself.

#### Structure

The **structure** of your pitch is up to you. 

A **story** is an effective and proven way to structure your pitch. 

Humans have been telling stories for thousands of years, and our **brains** are wired to emotionally respond to stories more than to facts and figures. When someone tells you a story, the same areas of your brain and their brain get active. If they say "Danny kicked the ball..." your motor cortex, which coordinates your body movements, will fire up. That's how powerful stories are.

You can frame your pitch as a story in a couple of ways:

* Challenge > process > outcome (from a client point of view)

* Problem > solution > result (from a user point of view)

#### Slides

Your slides should help your audience focus on your key points. If you put too much text in your slides, you'll end up confusing people.

Tip: **one point per slide**.

> Avoid showing what you are saying and saying what you are showing.	

#### Delivery

When you stand up to present your project, remember that *everyone wants you to win*.

If you're a little nervous, take a few **deep breaths**. 

Throughout your presentation, get comfortable with **silence**. Everyone needs a bit of it to digest what you're saying.

> Silence is better than bullshit.


#### Let's rehearse: 10 minutes per team

# Class feedback for presentations

In the last formative assessment session there were very few comments from the class on peer presentations. 

This time I would like each team to make **at least** one comment within each of the sections (well done & action points) for each of the presenting teams. This is a requirement of your assessment session. 

With this in mind, I have added some pointers for considerations when thinking about how others present to the [collaborative google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cW9c043pbbLUu4HqNzMb3PkmUBJVJTtw376MKu2WgpE/edit?usp=sharing)

Theses are also the points that will be considered when your presentation is assessed. 

Let's take a moment to look through these. 


# Hand-in checklist

### Moodle link

**Upload** and submit your `WEB14204-Name-Surname.md` through Moodle here [moodle.rave.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=96596](https://moodle.rave.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=96596)
