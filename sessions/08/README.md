# Homework

* Keep prototyping (next week you'll user-test your prototypes at the school)

### Rapid prototyping

In an iterative approach to UX design, rapid prototyping is the process of **quickly mocking up the future state of a system** and testing it with users, teammates and clients.

Doing this **rapidly and iteratively** generates feedback early and often in the process, improving the final design and reducing the need for costly changes during development.

#### What is a prototype then?

A prototype **answers questions**. The more specific the better.

A prototype stands between your **assumptions** and your users **behaviours**.

A prototype should be **quick** (and cheap) to make, re-make and possibly discard.

A prototype should be **close** to the real thing.

A prototype is **not the real thing**.

#### Which prototyping tool should I use?

Each prototyping tool has its own feature set and strengths. Based on your needs and the requirements of your project, evaluate which tool is more appropriate:

1. How **easy** is it to learn and use the tool?
* Are there a repositories of **reusable templates** or widgets available?
* How easy is it to make changes on the fly or to **incorporate feedback**?
* Does it have any **collaboration features**, such as allowing multiple people to work on it at the same time?
* What are the licensing terms and **costs**?

#### Your turn

**Prototype two user flows**

1. *Onboarding* process (the process of increasing the likelihood that *new users* adopt your product and keep using it, see [UserOnboard](http://www.useronboard.com/)).
* A problematic scenario, aka *edge case* or *unhappy path* (of your choice)

Produce prototypes that address [your user stories](#your-stories).

### Blog

For those who took part in the workshops: when working with kids and **teaching them about UX design**, what *strategies* and *techniques* have you tried / discovered, which made your life easier? 

For example:

* Using whiteboards to make sentences easier for them to read out loud
* Assigning specific roles to groups of kids (eg: the *research table*, the *design table*, the *logo table*...)
* Making use kids don't feel intimidated by adults (1 kid with 2+ adults → intimidated; more kids than adults → empowered)

Imagine that someone who has never worked with children before were to ask you for advice. 

Write a blog post with your **top tips and tricks**, explaining how and why they work!
