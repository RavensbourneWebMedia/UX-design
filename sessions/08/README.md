# Homework

### Rapid prototyping

[Last week](../07#your-turn-1) we asked you to **prototype two user flows**:

1. The **onboarding** process: how does your app *welcome new users* and help them find their feet (learning what they can do, where to find things, and start using the features)? You can find very detailed breakdowns of other app's onboarding at [UserOnboard](http://www.useronboard.com/)).
* A problematic scenario, aka an *edge case* or *unhappy path* of your choice. For instance, what happens when your typical user makes a mistake, can't find what s/he is looking for, or generally when something goes wrong?

**Keep prototyping** using your tool of choice (we recommend [Invision](http://www.invisionapp.com)).

Next week you'll user-test your prototypes at the primary school.

Remember [the dos and don'ts of user-testing](../04#dos-and-donts)?

### Blog

For those who took part in the workshops: when working with kids and **teaching them about UX design**, what *strategies* and *techniques* have you tried / discovered, which made your life easier? 

For example:

* Using whiteboards to make sentences easier for them to read out loud
* Assigning specific roles to groups of kids (eg: the *research table*, the *design table*, the *logo table*...)
* Making use kids don't feel intimidated by adults (1 kid with 2+ adults → intimidated; more kids than adults → empowered)

Imagine that someone who has never worked with children before were to ask you for advice. 

Write a blog post with your **top tips and tricks**, explaining how and why they work!
