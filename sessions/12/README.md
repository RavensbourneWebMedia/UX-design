# Homework

Next session will be **Wednesday the 17th**. We'll have our *friends* from SCWA over to **user-test your prototypes**. So, continue working on your prototype and be ready to test it (in whatever state it is in: sketch, paper-prototype, digital prototype).

### Blog

Review [Nupinion](http://beta.nupinion.com/) from a UX point of view. 

* **Audience**: who is it for, and why should they care?
* **Interface**: how does it present content? How well does it address the (assumed) audience needs?
* **Improvements**: what would you change, if anything, and why? Sketches/screenshots welcome.
