Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!


# Guest talk

Our guest Amy Jackson-Bruce (Web Media alumna) will tell you how 3 Tate apps she worked on were designed. From defining the problem to prototyping (paper and digital) and user-testing.

### Ideation on post-it notes

### Creating digital prototypes 

	
# Homework

### Keep prototyping

**Prototype** two user flows:

1. The **onboarding** process: how does your experience **attract new users**? How does it **engage** them with its content? 
	
	Chris at the Maritime Museum observed that 
	
	> ...typically the most played video in an interactive piece at the museum is *the first video*, no matter what its content is. We tested this hypothesis by randomising the order in which videos are presented to visitors, and the results speak clearly: the most popular videos are the ones that require less tapping / scrolling to get to. Which means most visitors may watch one video, then move on. So how do we make that experience better? How do we get them to watch another?
	
* A **problematic scenario** (aka an *edge case* or *unhappy path*) of your choice. 

	For instance, what happens when your typical user makes a mistake, can't find what s/he is looking for, or generally when **something goes wrong**?
