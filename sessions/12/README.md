# Week 12

### Today, Wednesday 9th May 2018

Prototyping with our special guest Tor.  Today we will work through your paper prototypes and create frunctional, detailed digital prototypes by the end of the day. 

These will then be the basis of a user testing session with the Year 3 Web Media students next week. 

Some [notes from Tor's talk and workshop are here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qKUGTfI3hpiKvvR4-iC5Hhd8otNUv3ZiruVTaPkz-es/edit?usp=sharing).

Your [homework](#homework) and [blog](#blog)!

# Homework

Next session will be **Wednesday the 16th May**. In the morning we will have formative presentations of your concepts & prototypes so far. Then we'll have our *friends* from Web Media Year 3 with us to **user-test your prototypes**. So, continue working on your prototype and be ready to present and test it next week (digital & paper prototypes at the ready please).

### Blog

Look back over the **inspriing projects** given to you in the project brief at the [beginning of term.](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/UX-design/tree/2018/projects/filter-bubbles#inspiring-projects) 

They were: 

* [Googling Freedom:](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stml/sets/72157649456886632/) a practical demonstration of a filter bubble

* [FriendFlop:](http://fffff.at/friendflop) a browser extension for Chrome that scrambles the identities on your Twitter or Facebook timelines, dissolving your biases and "reminding you that everyone is saying the same shit anyway"

* [LoveMachine:](http://p.xuv.be/tag/lovemachine) a little app that clicks all the likes available in your timeline, automatically

* [What would I say:](http://what-would-i-say.com/about.html) automatically generates Facebook posts that sound like you!

After look at each project choose which is most relevant to your filter bubbles concept and review your experience of that project detailing: 

* **Audience**: who is it for, and why should they care?
* **Interface**: how does it present content? How well does it address the (assumed) audience needs?
* **Improvements**: what would you change, if anything, and why? Sketches/screenshots welcome.
