#### TL;DR

The [National Maritime Museum](http://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum) (NMM) in Greenwich wants you to design the UX of an interactive exhibit about the Museum's vast **collection of maps and charts from the 16th and 17th centuries** and deliver your proposal by the 6th of March 2017!

### Context

The NMM will open four new [Endeavour Galleries](https://www.hlf.org.uk/about-us/news-features/endeavour-galleries-national-lottery-success-ahoy) in 2018.

The interactive exhibit you will design will be part of the **Tudor and Stuart Seafarers** gallery, which is about Britain's emergence as a maritime power in the 16th and 17th centuries.

In the early modern period explorers like Colombo, Vespucci and Da Gama opened up new maritime routes, changing European and World history for ever. At the time, Britain was a small nation at the periphery of Europe. By the end of the 17th century its colonies were stretching over the entire World.

In those two centuries there was a boom in *map-making*, as maps were both indispensable *tools* to navigate the sees, and precious *propaganda objects* for those in powers to show off their dominions. Your interactive exhibit will be part of the **Mapping the World** section, at the entrance of the gallery.

### Key message

The interactive exhibit should have **one** key message, one thing that visitors will come away with.

A couple of (bad) examples:

* Visitors will appreciate the Museum’s unrivalled collection of charts and maps from the Tudor and Stuart periods (but showing all the maps in the collection may be a terrible idea...)

* Visitors will become aware that maps and charts were made and used for a variety of purposes (but which purposes specifically?)

You're encouraged to develop your own key message, along the lines of: 

> Within `X amount of time` and through `Y content` presented via `Z technology`, visitors will learn `key message`

Depending on your key message, your exhibit could present a **broad** collection of archived materials, or a **focused** collection of particular objects (or anything in between). The purpose of your exhibit could span from **learning** to **making**.

### Audience

**Pick one** of the 14 museum visitor segments (see below) and make sure that your design choices are appropriate for their interests, needs, cultural reference and skills.

1. Fashion Young
* Trendy Parents
* Premium Mid Life Independents
* Explore and Discover
* High Culture Vultures
* Broadening Horizons

#### Dos :+1:

* Asking visitors to collect items / complete tasks
* Use characters / stories to convey factual information
* Make sure that you **explain the interface** to your visitors (don't force it on everyone, but make it available if someone is lost)
* How can you let people experience the same piece without creating bottle-necks? **Non-linear narratives** and experience that don't rely on a single entry point can help manage the *traffic* in the gallery space.
* **Randomisation** of content, so that visitors are not exposed to the same content.

#### Dont's :-1: 

* Avoid dry paragraphs
* Do visitors understand that the piece can be interacted with, and is it clear how they can interact with it?  
  
	If something looks like a poster, then people will treat it like a poster, and not interact with it.  
  
	If visitors don't understand the interface (*does this look like a button?* and *how am I meant to tap this?* kind of questions) then they won't interact with the piece.


### Technology

Your starting point is a 32" touch screen (red rectangle in the image below) with audio output and internet connection. 

Your proposal can add extra technology on top of that, as long as it fits with your [key message](#key-message).

### Constraints

**Time**: the duration of the interactive experience should be max 5 minutes

**Accessibility**: all interactive objects will be set at an accessible height for visitors in wheelchairs. There should be a row of easy to reach navigation icons for visitors with restricted reach.

Here's a [sample of maps and charts](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tEg72Z_1cyxSUN1VfkW8Oke9gOZtmok0DRQ3odi61_4/edit?usp=sharing) from the NMM collection.

### Deliverables

In other words, what the client wants you to deliver:

* What's the **key message** of the interactive exhibit?
* **Audience**: who is it for, and why should they care? How have you catered to their needs, interests and skills
* **Narrative**: how do you present the collection's content so that it's interesting for you chosen audience and fits with your key message? What stories will your exhibit tell?  
* What the visitor will see/experience on approaching it, aka **onboarding**?
* How do visitors **interact** with the exhibit?
* What **reward(s)** will the exhibit offer to visitors?
* How does the exhibit re-sets itself on **conclusion** of the interaction? 
* Interactive **prototypes** of your idea 
* **User-testing report**
