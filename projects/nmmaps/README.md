# NMMaps

The [National Maritime Museum](http://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum) (NMM) in Greenwich wants you to design the UX of an interactive exhibit about the Museum's vast **collection of maps and charts**. 

### Context

The interactive exhibit will be part of the [Endeavour Galleries - Tudor and Stuart Seafarers](https://www.hlf.org.uk/about-us/news-features/endeavour-galleries-national-lottery-success-ahoy), which will open in 2018.

- [ ] TODO more content from the brief here

http://collections.rmg.org.uk/collections.html to familiarise yourself with the collection

### Key message

The interactive should have one key message, one thing that visitors will come away with.

<!-- Through the interactive exhibit visitors will be able to: -->

Example key messages could be:

* Visitors will explore the Museum’s unrivalled collection of charts and maps from the Tudor and Stuart periods (but showing all the maps in the collection could be a terrible idea...)

* Visitors will become aware that maps and charts were made and used for a variety of purposes

You're welcome to come up with your own key message. 

`In this space in X amount of time, this is what visitors should be doing`

### Audience

Pick one of the segments [TODO add link] and make sure that your design choices are appropriate for the audience needs and skills.

### Technology

Your starting point is a 32" touch screen, with audio output and internet connection. 

Your proposal could add extra technology on top of that, as long as it fits with the `key message`. 

### Constraints

Time: the duration of the interactive experience shouldn't be more than 5 minutes

- [ ] TODO Accessibility

### Deliverables

In other words, what the client wants you to deliver:

* *Key message* of the interactive and your interpretation (if you've changed from the given goal, and how does this relate to the audience)
* Primary *audience*: who is it for, and why should they care? How have you catered to their needs, interests and skills
* A statement of the exhibit’s *context* in the gallery 
* A description of the exhibit *narrative*, what's your angle 
* What the visitor will see/experience on approaching it (*onboarding*)
* The nature of the visitor’s *interaction* with the exhibit
* A description of the interaction and the *reward* at the conclusion of the interaction
* A description of how the exhibit re-sets itself on *conclusion* of the interaction 
* Interactive *prototypes* of your idea 
* *User-testing report*
