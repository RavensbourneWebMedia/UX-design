# NMMaps

The [National Maritime Museum](http://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum) (NMM) in Greenwich wants you to design the UX of an interactive exhibit about the Museum's vast **collection of maps and charts**. 

### Context

The interactive exhibit will be part of the [Endeavour Galleries - Tudor and Stuart Seafarers](https://www.hlf.org.uk/about-us/news-features/endeavour-galleries-national-lottery-success-ahoy), which will open in 2018.

Through the interactive exhibit visitors will be able to: 

* Explore the Museum’s unrivalled collection of charts and maps from the Tudor and Stuart periods
* Become aware that maps and charts were made and used for a variety of purposes. 

<!--
Digital experiences can vary from presenting a **broad** collection of archived materials to a **focused** collection of particular objects, for the purpose of **learning** or **making**.

For example:
