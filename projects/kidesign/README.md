# Kidesign

On this **team project** you will learn the methods and tools of *user research* and *iterative design*, by engaging with a challenging user group: primary school children and (their) parents. 

Design the **UX** and build the **prototype** of a Web-based service for primary school kids and/or parents.


### Context

<!-- from https://speakerdeck.com/destraynor/the-language-of-interfaces -->

* Web-*sites* are turning into Web-*apps*: one does not simply *read* an app.
* The Web is being rebuilt around **people**, aka *the users* (think comments, recommendations, wish lists, personalised feeds..)
* **Social networks** are the most popular Web-apps for people to connect and interact with each other online
* A social Web-app is a gamble on **content** (will people **produce** content for your app?)
* The people use the **interfaces** (that you design) to do this
* You control the *user interface*, the *[blank slate](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/BlankSlate)* for new users, and the *content definition* (it's called *tweet*, not *share*, *post*, *update* etc.)
* Interfaces influence **behaviour**, and words influence **relationships** (*friends*, *partners*, *buddies*, *colleagues* etc.)
* The words you put on something, be it an **action** or a relationship, define your app.
