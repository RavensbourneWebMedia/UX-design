# Kidesign

On this **team project** you will learn the methods and tools of *user research* and *iterative design*, by engaging with a challenging user group: primary school children. 

#### Learning goals

* Research digital services aimed at children and schools
* Practice UX research methods such as interviews and focus groups
* Produce interface prototypes 
* Plan and execute user testing sessions

### Design the **UX** and build the **prototype** of a Web-based product for primary school children.

For example:

1. Research and **re-design** an app that primary school children are using in a learning environment.

	* What apps are schools currently using? 
	* What's the interaction between kids, parents and teachers?
	* What are the things kids want to share? Who do they share these with and how?
	* What are the interfaces they find most challenging? 
* Research and design an app that helps primary school children **collaborate** with their teachers and/or parents. 

	Design the app experience so that (one or more of the below):

	* multiple users can interact on the screen at the same time, as opposed to one person controlling the app while the other watches
	* the experience extends beyond the screen and into the physical world
	* the app doesn't assume that kids are lesser beings than their parents / teachers
* Research and design an app experience for primary school children to **learn a discrete skill / concept** (one or more from the list below) in a playful environment:

	* drawing
	* letters and sounds
	* writing
	* spelling
	* vocabulary
	* storytelling
	* counting
	* addition (and other maths operations)
	* logical reasoning
	* computational thinking
	* emotional literacy
	* something else (which you found through observing or interviewing children)

Primary school children are aged 5-11, which is a rather broad range as they develop massively during those years (so the needs and skills of a 5 year-old will be very different from those of an 11 year-old). You may want to pick a narrower range, eg: 5-7 or 9-11.

### Context

From [Designing Web interfaces for kids](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/designing-web-interfaces-for-kids/) by [Trine Falbe](https://twitter.com/trinefalbe)

> Kids spend a lot of time online, and their cognitive and physical limitations present many challenges to them when they do so. Pair that with poorly designed content and dark patterns, and you have a bad mix. As designers on the web, **we have a responsibility to create things that empower kids** and make them smarter, not the opposite.


<!-- from https://speakerdeck.com/destraynor/the-language-of-interfaces 

* Web-*sites* are turning into Web-*apps*: one does not simply *read* an app.
* The Web is being rebuilt around **people**, aka *the users* (think comments, recommendations, wish lists, personalised feeds..)
* **Social networks** are the most popular Web-apps for people to connect and interact with each other online
* A social Web-app is a gamble on **content** (will people **produce** content for your app?)
* The people use the **interfaces** (that you design) to do this
* You control the *user interface*, the *[blank slate](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/BlankSlate)* for new users, and the *content definition* (it's called *tweet*, not *share*, *post*, *update* etc.)
* Interfaces influence **behaviour**, and words influence **relationships** (*friends*, *partners*, *buddies*, *colleagues* etc.)
* The words you put on something, be it an **action** or a relationship, define your app.
