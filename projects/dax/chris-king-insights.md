### Design challenges

* **Network coverage** is patchy, digital experiences shouldn't rely on it
* **Lighting conditions** can hugely impact experiences that involve image recognition (for instance in the Great Map area)
* Typically the most played video in an interactive piece at the museum is *the first video*, no matter what its content is. We tested this hypothesis by randomising the order in which videos are presented to visitors, and the results speak clearly: **the most popular videos are the ones that require less tapping / scrolling to get to**. Which means most visitors may watch one video, then move on. So how do we make that experience better? How do we get them to watch another?
* What if you have 30 kids in the same space, using the same interactive piece? What if the experience has a *bottle-neck* and everyone has to start on the same spot?

### Dont's :disappointed: 

* Avoid dry paragraphs
* Do visitors understand that the piece can be interacted with, and is it clear how they can interact with it?  
  
	If something looks like a poster, then people will treat it like a poster, and not interact with it.  
  
	If visitors don't understand the interface (*does this look like a button?* and *how am I meant to tap this?* kind of questions) then they won't interact with the piece.

### Dos :smile: 

* Asking visitors to collect items / complete tasks
* Use characters / stories to convey factual information
* Make sure that you **explain the interface** to your visitors (don't force it on everyone, but make it available if someone is lost)
* How can you let people experience the same piece without creating bottle-necks? **Non-linear narratives** and experience that don't rely on a single entry point can help manage the *traffic* in the gallery space.
* **Randomisation** of content, so that visitors are not exposed to the same content.

### Misc

[Project Tango](https://www.google.com/intl/ALL_uk/atap/project-tango/) by Google is very interesting to museum curators because it allows to create an **unobtrusive digital layer**: no extra physical material in the gallery, it's all digital.

[GuidiGo](https://www.guidigo.com/) is a CMS + app that enables curators to make interactive tours that museum visitors can experience in different ways (text, images, audio, video, AR, VR etc.)
