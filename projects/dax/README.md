Aka **d**igital **a**rchive e**x**perience.

This **team project** focuses on the methods and tools of *digital prototyping*. 

#### Learning goals

* Evaluate the UX of existing digital platforms (in particular we'll evaluate [izi.travel](https://izi.travel/en), a digital tours and storytelling CMS)
* Plan and create engaging content for a target audience (in particular, visitors to the [Maritime Museum](http://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum) in Greenwich)
* Produce interactive prototypes for your app idea(s) 
* Plan and execute user-testing sessions

### Design and prototype a **d**igital **a**rchive e**x**perience.

* What makes a museum (intended as physical collection on display) experience unique? 
* Can you reproduce some of these qualities in a digital experience?
* Can a digital experience allow users to *play* with the artefacts within a collection? 
* How would such *digital manipulations* be useful / educational? 
* What are the most experimental things you could do with a collection? 

Take a body of work or archived material from the [Maritime Museum](http://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum) and prototype a digital experience that opens this up to the public.

Digital experiences can vary from presenting a **broad** collection of archived materials to a **focused** collection of particular objects, for the purpose of **learning** or **making**.

For example:

### Context

In the *internet age* we consume more and more pixels, apps, websites and information from digital displays. Museums and galleries have started to embrace the Web as an additional gallery space to show their archive, artistic and audio visual collections. 

In this context the Web offers cultural institutions a way of extending their collections into the everyday lives of art, history and science lovers not only in their immediate vicinity but internationally.
