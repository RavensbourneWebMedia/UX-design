## Context

Even though it was invented less than 30 years ago, **the Web has revolutionised every aspect of our lives**: the way we socialise, the way we work, they way we shop, the way we produce and consume information. Among many positive changes, the Web has also enabled the precarisation of work, pervasive surveillance, fake news, and *filter bubbles*. 

As **Web designers and digital citizens**, how do we respond to these changes? Can we re-imagine and prototype how people experience the Web? 

### What are filter bubbles?

The idea of [filter bubbles was proposed by Eli Pariser (watch this video)](http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?language=en#t-53082) to describe the effects of the *invisible algorithmic editing of the Web* by companies like Facebook and Google. As algorithms personalise content based on our preferences we are exposed only to what we *like*, and we don't get to see information that could challenge or broaden our worldview. Algorithms that we don’t see and don’t control are becoming the new gatekeepers, deciding which data, news and opinions will reach us and which won’t.

Eli Pariser argued that filter bubbles would ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy. So far his prophecy was spot on. Think fake news and *post-truth* politics, Brexit and Trump.

So what should we do about filter bubbles?


## Your brief

Design and prototype a *digital object* (an app, a website, a game, a browser plugin, a bot... or anything in between) that helps people achieve any combination of the below:

* Become aware of filter bubbles
* Reflect on the impact of filter bubbles on their personal experiences
* Change their media consumption habits to burst some of those bubbles
* Anything else you can argue is relevant to the topic

Your digital object prototype can be realistic, utopian or dystopian.


## Deliverables

* A map of your **personal filter bubbles**
* **10 ideas** for your digital object
* **Concept one-pager** of your chosen idea
* **Audience**: who is it for, and why should they care?  
* Interactive **prototypes** of your digital object
* **User-testing report**

## Inspiring projects

* [Nupinion](http://www.nupinion.com/) is a toolbox that allows you to get a well-rounded view from multiple sources, find opposing perspectives, avoid fake news and pop your news bubble.

* [Googling Freedom](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stml/sets/72157649456886632/) is a practical demonstration of a filter bubble

* [Selfie City](http://selfiecity.net/) investigates social media self-portraits in five cities across the world

* [FriendFlop](http://fffff.at/friendflop) is a browser extension for Chrome that scrambles the identities on your Twitter or Facebook timelines, dissolving your biases and "reminding you that everyone is saying the same shit anyway"

* [LoveMachine](http://p.xuv.be/tag/lovemachine) is a little app that clicks all the likes available in your timeline, automatically

* [I know where your cat lives](http://iknowwhereyourcatlives.com) is a data experiment that visualises a sample of 1 million public pics of **cats** on a world **map**. This project explores two uses of the internet: the sociable and humorous appreciation of domesticated felines, and the status quo of personal data usage by startups and international megacorps who are riding the wave of decreased privacy for all.

* [What would I say](http://what-would-i-say.com/about.html) automatically generates Facebook posts that sound like you!

* [TinderIn](http://driesdepoorter.be/tinderin/) puts profile pictures from LinkedIn & Tinder of the same person, side by side.

### Food for thought

* How might you present data to influence the perspectives, actions and decisions of others?

* What are some unexpected or uncomfortable datasets we don't often think about?

* What is the most interesting data you can find? What is an unexpected way to experience it?

* How can you make your point(s) of view emerge without distorting the source data?

* What is the intended or expected use of the data you're obtaining, and how might you use it differently?

If you're interested in how filter bubbles impact our lives, and want to explore the related concept of *information obesity* I recommend this book: [The information diet](http://www.informationdiet.com) by Clay Johnson

### Data sets

* [UK Government](http://data.gov.uk/data/search)
* [UniStats](https://unistats.direct.gov.uk/open-access-data)
* More to come

### Tools

* [Data selfie](https://dataselfie.it/#/) is a browser extension that tracks you while you are on Facebook to show you your own data traces and reveal how machine learning algorithms use your data to gain insights about your personality.

	The tool explores our relationship to the online data we leave behind as a result of media consumption and social networks - the information you share consciously and unconsciously.

* [RAWgraphs](http://rawgraphs.io) allows you to convert spreadsheet data into a [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)-based visualisation 

* [Import.io](https://import.io/) is a service that lets you turn website data into API data
