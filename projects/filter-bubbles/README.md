## Context

Even though it was invented less than 30 years ago, **the Web has revolutionised every aspect of our lives**: the way we socialise, the way we work, they way we shop, the way we produce and consume information. Among many positive changes, the Web has also enabled the precarisation of work, pervasive surveillance, fake news, and *filter bubbles*. 

As **Web designers and digital citizens**, how do we respond to these changes? Can we re-imagine and prototype how people experience the Web? 

### What are filter bubbles?

The idea of [filter bubbles was proposed by Eli Pariser (watch this video)](http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?language=en#t-53082) to describe the effects of the **invisible algorithmic editing of the Web** by companies like Facebook and Google. As algorithms personalise content based on our preferences we are exposed only to what we *like*, and we don't get to see information that could challenge or broaden our worldview. Algorithms that we don’t see and don’t control are becoming the new gatekeepers, deciding which data, news and opinions will reach us and which won’t.

Eli Pariser argued that filter bubbles would ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy. So far his prophecy was spot on. Think fake news and *post-truth* politics, Brexit and Trump.

So what should we do about filter bubbles?


## Your brief

Design and prototype a *digital object* (an app, a website, a game, a browser plugin, a bot...) that helps people achieve any combination of the below:

* Become aware of *personalisation algorithms*
* Become aware of the *filter bubbles* those algorithms generate 
* Understand how filter bubbles lead to *unconscious bias* (the information you consume is biased, but you are not fully aware of that), which in turn can result in the rise of *fake news*
* Reflect on the *impact* of filter bubbles on their personal experiences
* Change their *media consumption habits* 
* *Burst* some of their filter bubbles 
* Evaluate digital media for validity and accuracy
* Teach others to do the same
* Anything else you can argue is relevant to this project's theme

Your digital object prototype can be *realistic*, *utopian* or *dystopian*.


## Deliverables

Create a WEB14204-Name-Surname.md MarkDown document (where Name is your own name and Surname is your own surname, like WEB14204-Matteo-Menapace.md).

In that MarkDown document, include the following:

* A map of your **personal filter bubbles**
* **10 ideas** for your digital object
* **Concept one-pager** of your chosen idea
* Interviews
* **Audience**: who is it for, and why should they care?  
* Paper **prototypes**
* Interactive **prototypes** of your digital object
* **User-testing report**
* Concept video
* Landing page
* Summative **pitch**
* Blog posts

This mark down document will also need to contain all of the Deliverables for your Term 2 brief, clearly labelled and modified after formative 2 feedback. Together with your Term 3 work, this will make your complete project submission for the 2 terms.

## Inspiring projects

* [Nupinion](http://www.nupinion.com/) is a toolbox that allows you to get a well-rounded view from multiple sources, find opposing perspectives, avoid fake news and pop your news bubble.

* [Googling Freedom](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stml/sets/72157649456886632/) is a practical demonstration of a filter bubble

* [FriendFlop](http://fffff.at/friendflop) is a browser extension for Chrome that scrambles the identities on your Twitter or Facebook timelines, dissolving your biases and "reminding you that everyone is saying the same shit anyway"

* [LoveMachine](http://p.xuv.be/tag/lovemachine) is a little app that clicks all the likes available in your timeline, automatically

* [What would I say](http://what-would-i-say.com/about.html) automatically generates Facebook posts that sound like you!

<!--

* [Selfie City](http://selfiecity.net/) investigates social media self-portraits in five cities across the world

* [TinderIn](http://driesdepoorter.be/tinderin/) puts profile pictures from LinkedIn & Tinder of the same person, side by side.

* [I know where your cat lives](http://iknowwhereyourcatlives.com) is a data experiment that visualises a sample of 1 million public pics of **cats** on a world **map**. This project explores two uses of the internet: the sociable and humorous appreciation of domesticated felines, and the status quo of personal data usage by startups and international megacorps who are riding the wave of decreased privacy for all.

### Food for thought

* How might you present data to influence the perspectives, actions and decisions of others?

* What are some unexpected or uncomfortable datasets we don't often think about?

* What is the most interesting data you can find? What is an unexpected way to experience it?

* How can you make your point(s) of view emerge without distorting the source data?

* What is the intended or expected use of the data you're obtaining, and how might you use it differently?

### Data sets

* [UK Government](http://data.gov.uk/data/search)
* [UniStats](https://unistats.direct.gov.uk/open-access-data)
* More to come


### Tools

* [Data selfie](https://dataselfie.it/#/) is a browser extension that tracks you while you are on Facebook to show you your own data traces and reveal how machine learning algorithms use your data to gain insights about your personality.

	The tool explores our relationship to the online data we leave behind as a result of media consumption and social networks - the information you share consciously and unconsciously.

* [RAWgraphs](http://rawgraphs.io) allows you to convert spreadsheet data into a [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)-based visualisation. If you want to find out which viz is more appropriate for your idea, check out the [Dataviz Catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com).

* [Import.io](https://import.io/) is a service that lets you turn website data into API data

### Reading / watching list

* [How algorithms shape our world](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/kevin-slavin-how-algorithms-shape-our-world) by Kevin Slavin
* [Did Facebook’s big new study kill my filter bubble thesis?](https://backchannel.com/facebook-published-a-big-new-study-on-the-filter-bubble-here-s-what-it-says-ef31a292da95) by Eli Pariser
* The [Fluff Principle](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html) by Paul Graham Basically, in which he argues that "stream"-like UIs (Reddit/Twitter/Facebook) favour stuff that's easier to make quick judgments about (like memes and clickbait) over stuff that takes longer to judge (in-depth articles, long talks, etc). The result: ~shallow crap~ fluff everywhere.
