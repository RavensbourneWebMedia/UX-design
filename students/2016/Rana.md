# Rana Karim : Designing the user experience 

During this unit I delved into UX design for two projects, both requiring me to design and prototype interactive products.

##Kidesign: CodeFriend

During the kidesign project I worked closely with primary school children to prototype an interactive product that teaches them and allows them to learn something.

### Competitor analyses  

As a team our first idea was to create a product that teaches in fun way. We all then did our own [competitor analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByHkNH2IqZRJdTdqRXJFRXBLdzQ/view?usp=sharing) on products we thought were fun and could teach or could act as a learning tool. 

### Interviews debrief  

At this point of the process our team had decided to focus our interactive teaching product on coding and put together a script/guide to follow and use during our fist interview session with the the children.

- What are your favourite apps or games? What are you interested in? Can anyone explain what coding is?
- If you are not interested in coding, why not, would you like to learn more about it?
- Have you learned any languages? If so what languages? How did you learn them? How would you like to learn them?, would you like to learn a new language?

We then made our first trip to Invicta primary school to interview children to get some general knowledge about them and how they would react to our idea in order to design for them and create something they'd enjoy.

### Elevator pitch  

> "CodeFriend is a application that teaches children aged 9-11 the basics of HTML coding in a fun and interactive way"

### Wireframes ###

Using the feedback we collected from the initial interviews we started to develop our idea and create some initial sketches which we developed into paper wireframes to test with the children.

### Prototype ###

Our team was split between two ideas which we developed into paper prototypes and tested with the children. After that testing session we identified elements that  worked well with the target audience from both prototypes. As a team we then decided to take these elements and form it into one product.  

We then split this service into three sections which each team member worked on. I focused on prototyping the mid section/activity part of the service where the users needed to complete lines of code using HTML tags which would be able to identify any problematic scenarios. 

I thought the best way to test this part would be by creating a tutorial level of the service due to its heavy focus on teaching and easy difficulty level which I thought was ideal for people new to coding, our targeted users.

### User testing report

I then tested this prototype with the children in order to see weather the service fulfils all its goals with the targeted audience and to identify any errors to improve it.

##DAX: Explore Maritime##

During the DAX (digital archive experience) project I was tasked to prototype a interactive experience for visitors to The National Maritime Museum.

###Brainswarming###

We started the project by carrying out a brainswarming activity to generate some ideas for our interactive experience. 

At first we liked the idea of creating something new and personal from the collections available at the museum and wanted to create an experience that allows people to collect art from the museum and then create their own art piece from that by putting together collages from the pieces they had collected and to explore the different artists styles.

###User persona's###

###Concept one pager###

After our first trip to the museum we thought the idea we initially came up with from the brainswarming activity wasn't suitable for the content we saw there. Moreover we felt there was a lack of navigation and we weren't really immersed in the experience. 

We then decided we wanted to create an experience that will help help visitors with navigating to the collections or exhibits they wanted to see as well as giving them a more immersive experience.

###Experience Maps##

We then mapped out our experience which helped us develop and fully understand all the features/functions of our idea and how it works step by step.

###Prototypes###

Instead of initially prototyping the whole service we looked for potential pain points were users may struggle and make errors. As a team we decided to set up the first half of the service were users create and set up their tour.

###User testing report###

We then tested this prototype with visitors at the museum in order to see weather the service fulfils all its goals with the targeted audience and to identify any errors to improve it.

###Further Development###

After our user testing session and formative presentation we had plenty of feedback to develop our prototype and project.
