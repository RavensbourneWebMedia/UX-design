Competitor analysis 
--------

**Samsung IWB**

*Audience*: This targets the slightly older children in prime learning, aiming to develop new, more effective ways of delivering information to children. It also tries to implement new cutting edge ways of teaching using its main feature the Interactive White Board. Generally placed on top of a samsung screen activating multi-touch recognition for multiple students to use at the same time. 

*User goals*: IWB is meant to be used in a variety of different environments from classrooms to meeting rooms and i don't think they even know who it is for yet. They advertise to meeting rooms the same way they do to primary children. I don't think that IWB is for children but rather for teachers and lecturers attempting to improve their delivery of content. 

*Content*: IWB's content is very limited at the moment but from research I have learn that successful maths, spelling and multiple choice questions can be delivered and used in a teaching environment with no problems. The IWB is run from Samsungs very own CMS call IMS (interactive management solution) fancy for nothing in opinion. But essentially the teachers and lecturers can upload or create content using the CMS and that content can then be distributed across a school's network (they are also looking at sending the lessons home)

*Content definitions*: 'Seamless engagement' I feel that IWB has been taken fairly seriously and the use of abbreviations for long phrases means that they must be angling towards a generation that is tech-savy and able to 'catch' on to tech without much issue. I also believe that the product is in early stages so they are still branding and developing their customer base. It is however definitely not angled towards primary school children as you would first have to know your way around a windows (which isn't easy for anyone). 

*Calls to action*: Collaborate. Support. Lecture and tech with robust architecture. It is asking for people to get involved, take part, touch the screen of wisdom and be magically taken away. Hinting towards it simplifying your presentation pitch, teaching a primary class, delivering content in a board meeting etc. 

*Language*:'Delivery rich content and interactivity to the classroom or meeting room' kinda hints towards the IWB becoming a global product and also adds to it being less for children.

*Onboarding*: I think to get anywhere you have to buy a [IWB](https://www.google.co.uk/#q=samsung+iwb+3.0"but they so damm expensive"). I feel like that is the complete wrong angle, how can you create a product for mass use throughout education if it is so expensive in the first place you just limited your market to 3% of the world.

*Blank Slate*: Don't know 

*Usability & Usefulness*: Usability looks a bit shaky from videos, not always 100% responsive to user interactions, gets confused when many people touch it. Still has that 'digital' smell that is the opposite of 'seamless interaction'. Usefulness; maybe the product is effective if you need a 'high impact presentation solution' but is not going to do anything for your average teacher and classroom at the moment. 

**NearPod**

*Audience*: Nearpod is focussing way harder on students. Primarily for schools and teachers to use, but the end user is the school students learning through it.

*User goals*: the product allows teachers to send interactive content to a classroom/individual laptops for the students to engage with more interesting content, creating more interactions and alleviating the pressure on teachers to get a presentation in front of the class.  

*Content*: Nearpod produces content for All Key stages in All subjects. I assume as the company grows, so will their content base and as teachers use it for their own benefit, the UGC will grow substantially too. 

*Content definitions*: Everything is worded familiarly and aimed at children in education of all ages. You can click through into your age group and naturally as the topics are more in depth, so is the wording. What I like is that the content is produced by teachers for teachers and learners. Nobody else.

*Calls to action*: it is more like 'featured''shop now' 'top paid' 'top free'. the product wants you to take part and learn something online by downloading one of its lessons (first sign up and take all your details!!)

*Language*: Very familiar and active language used to 'get people going'. 'Create lessons your students will love' 'Engage your classroom' 

*Onboarding*: Anyone is able register for an account but they are focussing on entire schools that will use the software throughout with suitable tablets or pcs to run on. As this becomes more readily available in schools, then potentially their onboarding rate will increase. There is nothing that is pushing user conversion (nice for a change)

*Blank Slate*: I just registered and went over to the first free lesson I found and downloaded the preview to play. Simple click per slide approach to using going through the content. Cool that it stops and asks you how it went, how you're feeling etc as you go along the way (I wonder what it does with that information). Analysing this competitor has helped me better formulate the questions I will be asking during my interviews.

*Usability & Usefulness*: Usability is incredibly straight forward and simple to adopt if you've used a computer in the past 20 years. I believe children will have no problem picking up the touch and go mentality. Usefulness also scores well as this is really a new way for children to interact with content and learn.


Interviews debrief
----
After to testing the application and attempting the put a prototype in the hands of a potential user. 

*Improvement List*
Interface: focus on the individual important elements and nothing else 
Get to the point of what the app will do for me
Clear data about the children would be needed i.e reports have to be in order, parent/guardian information.
It would have to be secure.
A parent log in so they can have the app too (because the kids are young, so they need an eye kept on them)

*Likeable elements*
Fast
Can interact with the class efficiently 
Brilliant for teacher and even parents to help their kids learn.
'I wish I had resources like that when I was at school' 

*Key Points*
The interface and logic behind WhiteBoard is there and users (children and adults) are able to navigate through the obvious wireframes to access commonly looked for information

Needed to be better flesh out during the first interview rounds 

Have more content in the prototype to give a better idea of what a MVP would resemble.

Should ask short, more straight forward questions asking the tester to do a specific activity.

Tester will ramble on if you let them. 
 



Elevator pitch
----
Imagine if you could track your child's progress, see teacher reports, make sure they have access to all the learning material they could need, know they are having safe discussions with classmates, Imagine if homework could be done on their favourite play time device. For children and parents who are being educated in a dated system, WhiteBoard will revolutionise, simplify and speed up your child's learning.

I thought this was a good way to get ideas fleshed out, you spend time on each column and then it [all makes sense and is much clearer.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f8hT4n4rKA_vfWv2CXFFczrlBMhAPsxecoMOBBNny-o/edit#gid=571371745)

Brainswarming
----
I enjoyed collecting ideas & information in this way, it made a change from having 1 person that shouts their idea and listening to 'I like that idea but i only have one problem with it' constantly when they don't get what they want. 

User personas
----
User personas are in the same style as the others. I have actually made user personas and then user journeys and then user stories where they would interact for an unrelated project. I could show you that too if you were interested but here are the related [User personas](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1oDFGR8btFeLVVJMlVlYkxwQmM&usp=sharing)

Concept one-pager
---
I designed the one for the Whiteboard project almost alone so I thought someone else in my team could do it this time. I should of been more persistent with following up how my team is doing but I have my own stuff the deal with right now. 

Experience maps
---
I decided to flesh out a cleaner version of the experience map. I really think this is a useful process because it sounds much more complicated than it it. I like simple, efficient apps that are more like tools that things that are always promting users to sign up or buy something or shove an offer in their face. Those apps have no real valuble piece of technology. Pinpointing the most valube features and what will make the app tick smoothly.

Prototype(s)
---
Here are some of my initial drawing for the app, they look like a 5 year old has done them but at least they are filled with real content and solve a potential problem [see them here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1oDFGR8btFeVXhHR0tIUm9tLUE)
