**Elevator pitch**

A guide to help primary school children make a successful web search barely exists. School homework is always more effort than it should be. Until now. Our product gives you a buddy to help you with your searches and then a homepage with a quick navigational structure without being too cluttered. Kidzsearch and KidsClick are our closest competitors. As a well organised and enthusiastic team we have done the extra research needed to make ‘Search Buddy’. A site that kids can make their own with customisable backgrounds and buddy characters. We provide a fun site that has easy links to the main subject areas where children are most likely to need help with homework. The easy site to do easy searching. Search Buddy is your Buddy!

**Term 3**  

**Pitch** 

Our idea/innovation is to create a 3D tour guide phone app so you could find your way around the Maritime museum which would include augmented reality for the navigation side of the app. The app would feature its own tour guide which will give you information on artefacts and collections around the museum also the tour will be based around or on the question you answer when you first load up the app, which will be how long you will you be spending today in the museum? Then it will be do you have any accessibility or disability issues also it would ask whether you’re in a group or individual tour, based on that information you will receive a personal tailored tour around the museum which will suit you.
