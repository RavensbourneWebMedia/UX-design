### Introduction


This document will take you through all the work that I have produced myself and within the group I had for this project. The project brief was to create a prototype interactive game for the National Maritime Museum. Which we had to later present to them for a chance our idea being taken and developed. Below you will find a collection of links to the diferent areas we studied.

##### Formative Presentation
Below is a link of a google slides presentation for the Formative explaining what we had done half way through the project.

##### Summative Presentation
Below you will find the link to our summative presentation which we completed online using google slides. It will have a break down of what the project is about, who the target audience are and what it will look like. Additionally, you will find the sketches for the game, wireframes, experience maps. Further down this document you will find the link to the final prototype that we have created.

#####Competitor Analysis 

We attended the Maritime Museum and analysed the visitors experience and noted out findings. In addition to this we also ask a few questions on the interactive boards you find within the galleries. Also visiting and asking for feedback from the exhibitions held within the museum.

#####Elevator Pitch

Is a document that defines our idea. I also states our target audience in a quick few sentences.

#####Experience Map

A link will be attached for the experience map that was a useful tool we had. It gave us an understand of what the process wold be like for the user and allowed us to see how many steps/pages would be needed for our game.

#####User Personas

For this project we have made 2 persons relation to the people we have interviewed. They all tend to have common behavioural patterns when it comes to their choices. You can see what the average person below.

#####Wireframes

I will also be adding links to the wireframes we created for review as they where a main part of the project. They allowed us to put our ideas down on paper and see them visually. By doing this we was able to determine what pages we needed.

#####Prototype (s)

All together we had created three prototypes, the first on was on paper which we used to do our initial interviews, then we moved the paper copy to a digital version using an online software. Finally after feedback we began design our final version on photoshop. The links to the versions of our prototypes are below:

#####Concept video

We have created a quick 30 second video based on the idea of our game. It was created using Adobe Spark and online application to create short videos.

#####User Testing Report

This document below is a reprt of the interviews that had taken places within the museum. We had created our prototypes and then went into the museum and asked visitors to have a go at our game. We recording the game on video and noted some ansers to questions from the vistors.
