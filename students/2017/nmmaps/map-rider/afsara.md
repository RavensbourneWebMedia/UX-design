The National Maritime Museum located in Greenwich has asked Ravensbourne Web Media year 2 students to design the UX for a interactive board to display in an interactive exhibit. They specified that the UX will have to include their collection of maps and charts. I teamed up with fellow classmates Ajay Dhillon and Malore Milchard and we created an interactive voyage game targeted at Maritime Museum explorers aged 14-25 year olds. 

Throughout the weeks we had different tasks which included researching, interviewing, designing, prototyping and testing. Here are links to all our findings and research which led up to the creation of our game "Voyage: Through the Centuries".
