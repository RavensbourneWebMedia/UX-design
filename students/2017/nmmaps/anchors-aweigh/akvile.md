## Competitor analysis ##
I have made my competitor analysis document on Google Docs and it can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ktHaI45b-rEpAqZOYoh-5fdIHbWkoY8uDO-B8tXvsU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Elevator pitch ##
For our game ideas, we came up with 3 best choices as elevator pitches and then highlighted the one we thought would be the best one to go with and to use to develop our game idea further.

We also had some rough ideas before deciding on the three main ones which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18BKBICrICzdb-ogt4vZZV-rwD9fk2MBH_tlLvlZsy38).

They can be found in this [document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KYTApEcA3njJ0yOafi9Ajcd4KI1xcnQ8Alja30cyiBg).

## Concept one-pager ##
One part of the project was to create a concept one pager which will be a bit like a promotional poster about the game giving the  audience a little information about it. We all drew some sketches at first to get some ideas on how we wanted it to look like and then settled on a final idea and made it in Photoshop.

## Experience map ##
Our user experience map shows the progress in which the user will take to play and complete the game. The pain points powerpoint slide [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MzNHs3aRJRbQ4O6a5AT4LoSvkdnpDdDPIVSDRbt1mvI) shows how they might feel at different stages of the game.

## Formative presentation ##
Here is our first presentation which we showed at the Maritime Museum when we introduced our game idea to the staff there.

## User personas ##
Our user personas show the main and ideal target audience which we are aiming at with our game and who we want to attract and entertain while at the museum. Our main target audience are 5-12 year olds.

## Wireframes ##
We had also made wireframes for each section/page of our game and the content that will be visible on it.

Each wireframe is saved as new image: Page: [1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-Qb0x6bXo0MlRYcEk) [2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QbHRhbUVqbHZJcWM) [3](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QU0UzSzRHU3FCbE0) [4](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QQm5zLWRuS0tPUTg) [5](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QbnpSeTBTaUNSaGc) [6](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QMGdZM3lBekVTYzA) [7](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QbmFCVkkydEtTRDA) [8](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-Qcko1VDV2eGUzczA) [9](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QVnE1d3RiZW55VFU) [10](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QUGgtbi1kdDFrZ2s) [11](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QTmlkdFhaMGJxTVk) [12](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QWmhHeDJLV3FBaW8) [13](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QQU9ZSXFlNzdja28) [14](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QR3ZSYjYzbFg4Ylk) [15](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QcDIwVENYVW1JajA) [16](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QdEJpVzk3ZjBWNWM) [17](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QT3pKV3Atblg3YmM) [18](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QRkwtLVdzSlhhVkE) [19](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QT1VyQWhieGlLRjg) [20](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7EQ0WWNAA-QdlNQZlU2NnNnajA)

## Prototype(s) ##
We decided to create two options when it came to prototyping the look of the game. The first design covers a more traditional look, having the old and vintage looking books, coins and compass covering one of the maps from the 16th and 17th century era, which feels more authentic to the idea of the game and to the project brief itself. The idea of it was that the user would feel as though they are looking down on a Captain's table.

The second design was based more on being child friendly, with use of vivid colours to seem less serious and more fun to look at and be more attractive. We noticed however though most people who we asked preferred the first version and therefore we decided to go with the first game design for our final idea.

We had also created a logo for our game which would appear at the lock screen and the end of the game.

We also created some avatar ideas and a Skipper's License for users who have completed the game and would be able to print one out and take it home with them. They can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nlIHvtBIUFg9Np9lxiDwiML4-Orswd5y3_iVW5-KvuE).

## Concept video ##
This is our concept video for our Anchors Aweigh! game. The video was made by William and I created the logo for the game which is featured at the end of the video.

It can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7EQ0WWNAA-QeWJqNVNmcFl5Yjg/view?usp=sharing).
