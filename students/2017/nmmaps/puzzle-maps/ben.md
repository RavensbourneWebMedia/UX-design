### NMMaps

When given this project I was very excited as it is not something we have done before. I liked the idea that we had to visit the museums and gather important research. I also enjoyed the fact it was a group project as I believe it would have been very difficult to do this alone. 

We did struggle to decide on an Idea, and that's why we went into our Formative presentation with two ideas. However, with the feedback and our own opinions we did finally decide on an idea. It was to have different maps as puzzles and the audience would have to complete these puzzles. There would be information on the maps they are completing to make it more educational. Our target audience was 6-10 years olds. This was mainly because we see a lot of primary school classes visiting the museum.
