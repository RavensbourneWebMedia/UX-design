# UX/UI DESIGN FOR NMM PROJECT
For this project we worked alongside the National Maritime Museum to design an interactive museum attraction for their upcoming update in 2018. Following the brief, we were asked to produce an interactive piece that showed off the museumâ€™s vast collection of maps and present them to their visitors. 

## Competitor Analysis - 
Here is a document from which our group used to observe and evaluate different competitors exhibition interactives to work out the pros and cons of certain design elements and their interaction.

## Elevator Pitch -
We produced a short pitch that in theory you would use to introduce your project if you were given 10 seconds with them, _in an elevator_. The idea behind this is to summarise your product/project into as little words as possible but make it sound as interesting and viable as possible, so that the person you are talking to will want to learn more.

## Concept One Pager - 
A concept one pager works in a similar way to the elevator pitch, however it is a physical document that you can use to present to someone to summarise your idea.

## Experience Map -
Before beginning to design the product it is important to plot out your customer journey and workout the fundamental components of the application and how many screens you will need to design.

## Formative Presentation -
We created this presentation to present our initial idea, research & feedback,  to the group at the National Maritime Museum

## User Personas - 
Based on our trips to the **NMM** to conduct interviews and observations, we created two user personas based on our target audience.

## Design Ideas & Wireframes - 
After plotting our experience map and fine tuning the experience, we were able to begin designing some wireframes. Below you will find links to the different stages of development of our wireframes.

## Prototypes - 
Once our wireframes were created, and we were happy with the  structure and general layout, we were able to create prototypes that we could test live with our desired audience to further improve our idea.

### Prototype 1 - 
For this prototype we left out all the design elements and focused on the navigational aspects of the design.

### Prototype 2 -
In this prototype we included the design aspects of the interactive to engage our target audience more and get a better response to the user testing.

## Concept Video -
A concept video is a good way to promote and tell the story of your idea, even when the project is not finished. We created ours using Powtoon because it allowed for more interaction and animation on the screen than Adobe Spark and we thought that gave it more of an impact.

## User Testing Report - 
After our research (interviews, observations, user testing) we compiled all the information we gathered into this report.

## Summative Pitch - 
This was our final presentation to the NMM group and we structured it in the style of a pitch to best get across our idea. It is structured with a simple overview of how the idea works, our target audience and why, and a walkthrough of our _latest_ prototype. You can view the speaker notes for further information.
