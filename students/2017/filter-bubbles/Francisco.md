## Blogs

The following blogs were done based on what I've learned as a student so far. It allowed me to explore different topics and therefore expand my knowledge in terms of constructing my ideas better and developing them in a careful way, after going through several steps. It gave me more confidence to challenge myself, to make my own opinions and take them forward.
