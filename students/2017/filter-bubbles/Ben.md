When given this project I was quite worried and confused. Not only was I confused with Filter bubbles but what we had to produce at the end of the term. I also was worrying with the ideas I had as I did not have confidence in them. 
 
However, after user testing and tutorials I had an idea that I was confident with but also not too complex to produce. Below is my work and blogs which helped me to produce my final prototype.
