For this term we learned about Filter bubbles and were told to design and prototype a digital object such as an app or website. This product should help people understand what filter bubbles are.

To make sure I create an effective product I completed different tasks such as producing ideas, interviewing people, designing, prototyping and testing my product. Throughout these weeks I was able to gain many skills needed for UX design such as prototyping and using photoshop, which hopefully will help me in my future career. 

Below you can find all the links to see each of these findings which eventually lead to the creation of my final design called "BubbleZEN".
