Below you will find links to various different tasks I completed.

#####Mapping your filter bubbles	 

This documents contains a drawing of my filter bubble. From the top of my head I noted down all the things that I look/search on the web and put them in a bubble.

#####Interviews

Once I had written down my 10 ideas, my next task was to choose one of them to explore. I began conducting a few interviews to validate the choice I had in mind, to see if it was worth pursuing. I interviewed ages between 14-19, a younger audience as the idea i had would primarily be for that age group.

#####Concept Video

I designed and made a video based on my concept using Adobe Spark. It goes through the problems you may face when on apps looking to meet new people and then leads you on to the solution which is the product I've designed.

#####Landing Page

I've created a landing page for my project, I used the the carrd.co for inspiration. However, I decided to use photoshop to create it as you have more flexibily when you edit it unlike carrd.co.
