# UX Design : Filter Bubbles #

## My Filter Bubble ##
One of the first activities for this project was to explore our own filter bubbles and note down the things that we personally are interested in and want to see online.

I decided to create my filter bubble with also ideas and things that I personally tend to avoid looking at online and would rather skip those or not see them at all. These topics are placed outside of my bubble in the open area.

I based my filter bubble on the things I tend to use the internet most for, either if it is for looking at those things, reading about them or randomly finding them from ads given to me.

Exploring my own filter bubble made me realise about a lot of things that I don't really see on the internet by accident because everything I do or see is centred about my likes and even making this bubble and the things written inside of it was influenced by the things I see online, rather than just thinking about things off the top of my head.

## Ideas ##
When it came down to thinking of ways to be able to actually break the filter bubble and ways of expressing and visually displaying it, we had to come up with some ideas that would bring out the one that would work best. I managed to come up with 8 ideas that gave me some inspiration on how to make this work.

1. An app that only shows posts you always hide.
2. Twitter feed showing results of hashtags you use.
3. A browser plugin that notifies you about your similar likes saying: Not this again, try something new!
4. A chat bot that will always reply to you with things you don't like to see, read or hear.
5. An infograph showing in bubbles all of your most viewed content online (top 20 things).
6. An app that lets you click on one of your liked/favoured things and shows you all the topics either linked or not related to it.
7. A one page website showing stats of your social media accounts and internet browing history.
8. An experience/program that takes you through the process of filtering content.

## Idea Interviews ##
After choosing an idea which we would like to create, we needed to interview some people and ask them about what they think of the idea and what feedback and suggestions they would have towards its development, idea and name.

Here is a [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19lc4wf9K03YThzK8mZn21-xCZHPs2_WFgBQA7nsDmVI/edit?usp=sharing "Interviews") to a Word document which I created that has 3 interviews I've done with the questions I've asked and the answers that I received.

## Idea Sheet ##

**BubbleBurst**
: I went with this title as I received feedback from my interviews, more people liked this title, as it sounded more catchy, related to the topic and made sense.

I came up with the idea for this experience thinking about how a lot of people do not understand or know about the fact that everything they do is being tracked, traced and stored by websites and companies. A lot of people tend to forget that the information we see online is catered to ourselves and that we miss out on a lot of information because it does not fill into our filter bubble.

The experience idea will show the user how filtering on social media defines the things that they see online. The idea will surround and show a Facebook style homepage with a few click-able images that the users will be able to click on which will then filter based on what was clicked.

The concept is to show people that everything is filtered to their likes and only looking at things that they don't usually look at will force them to leave their comfort zone.

It is a psychological test to show how social media influences you to look at things and how it changes your opinions, evaluations and outcomes based on what is given to you on the screen.

# Creative Process #
## Planning the idea ##
When it came down to it, I did some planning on thinking what would be a good way to express this idea in visual form. I decided that having something familiar to the user, such as the Facebook interface, it will make it more relatable to them to understand how these companies filter data.

## Mechanics ##
Below is an imagine showing how I noted the ways in which I would want my experience to work and how it would filter data based on the choices made by the user. It shows how each choice leads to a different page/area which then filters into the choice that they've made. Also, choosing the same option multiple times will filter out the other options, making the user stuck in a cycle of data which is virtually the same.

## Paper Prototype ##
As I decided to use Facebook as my template for this idea, I simply did one sketch of what the pages would look like and which parts of the page I would use to display the different content. As I am focusing on images I will be only editing those.

## Digital Prototype ##
I decided to create my digital prototype on InVision. I find it very easy to use, simple and effective. It's a very useful tool to quickly create something that visually works exactly how you would want the real deal to look like.

I created a set of pages with the different content and linked each by using images. I've decided it will be a good idea to remove the main text areas from the pages as I want my user to focus on the visual images of the page rather than the text. The layout will still be the same as Facebook but without the text, the user can focus on making quick decisions on what to click, given only a few options to choose from, in this case, being a cat or a dog. I want to keep the idea simple so people do not get confused about it and can link an easy choice between two types of animals and understand the basic concept of filtering and how it works.

## Concept Video & Landing page ##
As my idea turned out to be more of an experience based experiment I didn't create a video for it as I was not aiming to advertise it to be an obvious thing. The point of this test was to make people realise what is happening rather than giving them an explanation. I would also not need a landing page as I want people to access the test right away and use it as a normal Facebook page. That is the idea of telling people in a psychological sense and forcing them to use common sense and their brain to understand what is happening.

# User Testing Feedback #
After creating my prototype I did user testing to see how it worked when people actually used the prototype and the evaluation they made from it. I asked them a couple of questions about it and their overall opinion on the idea.

## Future Improvements ##
For the future on this idea I would have liked to make it much more interactive. Having not just images, but text, links, buttons and all other parts of the page to be interactive for users to be able to play around and use different methods on the page to find out how content is filtered.

I would also definitely add a first page before the start of the experience to tell people the purpose of the test and if they can figure out what is happening and why.
