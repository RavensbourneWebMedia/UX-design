## Session 1

A bit too early to ask people to come up with project ideas.

Students suggested we show tools of the trade and inspirations (good and bad projects from previous years) in the first session, and then task everyone to come up with ideas for the next session.


## Session 2

It's fairly easy to pin down skills-based learning goals like `I want to get better at HTML`, how about challenging students with goals that are [more speculative or personal](http://goodenoughprofessor.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/on-civility.html)?

Less questions, more focus on *how do you learn*, *why do you think this is important* and *who can you learn from*

Maybe get everyone to write on the same *space* (eg comments on a blog post) rather than separately.


## Session 3

Explain difference between interview and survey / questionnaire
