## General

### Taking notes

* How many things can you remember from a lecture (or any piece of information)? Later today, tomorrow, in a month's time..

* Filter information. Let it seep through your brain, not just passively assorb it.

* **How to take notes?** Paper vs digital. What to write?

* Being respectful of whoever is talking (you can live without your phones for a short time)

## Session 1

A bit too early to ask people to come up with project ideas.

Students suggested we show tools of the trade and inspirations (good and bad projects from previous years) in the first session, and then task everyone to come up with ideas for the next session.

A general [introduction to UX by looking at toilets](http://www.slideshare.net/ChrisHow/ux-bar-campbrighton2013)?

Some [inspirational quotes from VIPz](https://userbrain.net/blog/design-the-user)?


## Session 2

It's fairly easy to pin down skills-based learning goals like `I want to get better at HTML`, how about challenging students with goals that are [more speculative or personal](http://goodenoughprofessor.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/on-civility.html)?

Less questions, more focus on *how do you learn*, *why do you think this is important* and *who can you learn from*

Maybe get everyone to write on the same *space* (eg comments on a blog post) rather than separately.


## Session 3

Explain difference between interview and survey / questionnaire.

## Session 7

### 5 seconds test

Need to get people to sign up and start collecting points so that they can publish their tests (bloody gamification)

Ask them to pay attention to the questions that they're asked when taking other people's tests and think about what questions they want to ask in their own tests

> What do you want to test?

Remember that when tested, people want to *win* or *get it right*, so make sure you're not asking **leading questions** that may give away what type of response you're expecting.

## Session 9

### Presentations

* Diagram to show where your product positions itself in relation to competitors
* I want to see the very first version of your sketches / wireframes (even if it's on toilet paper)

### Enhacements

* User personas are a bit disconnected from the other steps of the design process
* You should test your competitors, try to figure out why they went for certain features, really immerse yourself in their service and steal their ideas

### Ideas

* Quick *what-if* exercise with *variables* eg: a social network for {football fanatics} to {make friends} and {find soulmates}, calling each other {buddies} (take a look at that Twitter bot that posts game ideas..)

### Next term

* Develop the blank slate and onboarding process
* Keep presentations within time slots (which means, rehearse and time yourself)
* Community ranking / reputation
* Content strategy: UGC, editorial control, brands and advertising, spam
* Search and search results
* How to deal with trolls? Self-censoring community, reactive moderation, reporting, downvoting etc
