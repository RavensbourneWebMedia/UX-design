[Job stories](http://insideintercom.io/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/) are a simple and effective way to describe and break down the **basic units of functionality** of a system, focusing on **causality**, **anxieties** and **motivations**.

The basic idea behind job stories is that _people hire products/services to do jobs for them._

The format of a job story is:

**when _, I want __, so that I can ___.***   **situation → motivation → outcome**

Keep in mind that job stories describe jobs to be done, **not solutions**.

1.  Start with a high level job.
2.  Identify a smaller job or jobs which help resolve the higher level job.
3.  Observe [how people solve the problem now](http://insideintercom.io/making-things-people-want/) (which job do they currently use).
4.  Come up with a job story, or job stories, that investigate the causality, anxieties, and motivations of what they do now.
5.  Finally,  think of a solution (usually in the form of a website new feature or  changes to an existing feature) which addresses that job story.

Eg: let’s consider the scenario of a customer that wants to get in touch to the website owner.

1.  Typical first attempt: _When  a customer wants to get in touch with the website owner, s/he wants  to... get in touch with the website owner, so that s/he can... get in  touch with the website owner._ Obviously this is not a good job story. Why?
2.  Let’s address the outcome (_so that..._).  Ask yourself: why does the customer want to get in touch with the  website owner? What does she want from the website owner? What job does she want the site to do for her?

*   _When  a customer wants to get in touch with the website owner, s/he wants  to... get in touch with the website owner, so that s/he can book her  tickets to the next event_ (for instance) 

1.  Let’s address the situation (_when_).  Ask yourself: where is the customer when she is trying to get in touch  with the website owner? Is she in a rush? Is she on the move? Is she  anxious or frustrated about something?

*   _When a customer is checking the availability of tickets for the next event, she’s on her phone, on the bus_ (for instance)_,  anxious that they may have sold out and can’t find out a straight  answer, s/he wants to get in touch with the website owner, so that s/he  can book her tickets to the next event._

### Tips

*   List down all of the features of your site, even the most obvious ones
*   The same story can be written from different perspectives (eg: the seller vs the buyer)
*   Sometimes a top-level, generic story must be broken down into multiple, more specific stories
