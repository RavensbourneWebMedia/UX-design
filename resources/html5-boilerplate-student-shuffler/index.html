            Why not loading JavaScript here in the <head>? 

            It's good practice to leave JS files to be loaded at the end, when everything else in the document has loaded.

            If we loaded JS files here, people would have to wait until they're all loaded before seeing anything.

            To avoid people perceiving the page as being "slow to load", we can serve all the HTML and CSS first, and then load JS

            Think of it as a meal at a restaurant.. while you're waiting for your dish you're being served starters, so you won't mind waiting a few minutes longer.

        <!-- Why is this empty? -->
        <ul id="students"></ul>
        <!--
            We want this list of students to be different (random) every time we reload this page.

            We can't achieve this only with HTML & CSS. 
            We need JavaScript (JS) to randomise the list of students 

            We'll use the jQuery library (a toolbox of JS utilities) to manipulate students data and populate this page with students sorted randomly
