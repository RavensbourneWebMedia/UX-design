# Designing the UX

## [bit.ly/WEB14204](http://bit.ly/WEB14204)

This unit introduces you to the methods and tools used to effectively address the needs and circumstances of Web users, to design and produce Web interfaces that are comfortable and even joyful to use.

This includes:

* qualitative and quantitative **user research** 
* **competitor analysis**
* **User eXperience** (UX) design principles and patterns
* user **personas**, user **stories** and user **journeys**
* **interface design**: **paper-prototyping** and **wireframing**
* **rapid prototyping** tools
* **SEO**: search engine optimisation
* **user-testing**: face2face, A/B testing and analytics
* motivational **copy-writing** for stickiness

### What this unit is NOT

1. This unit is **not about honing your coding skills**.   

	Whilst you are welcome to **prototype** your ideas using HTML+CSS+JS, there are many tools that will get you to similar end-results without touching code (or not too much of it).

* This unit is **not about Photoshop wizardry**.   

	You will be introduced to several tools that enable you to **wireframe** (design user interfaces) quickly and effectively.

* In this unit **[Lorem ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) is banned**. 

	If a Web product aims to **deliver valuable content and facilitate meaningful interactions**, we should be designing **content-first** for the best possible UX. 
	
	Lorem Ipsum is gibberish that conveniently fills the available space like an expanding gas. It is inert, meaningless and lacks context, revealing nothing about the relationship between your design and your content.   
  
	Using Lorem Ipsum is a missed opportunity to do good UX design.


# Brief

Design the **UX** and build the **prototype** of a Web-based **social network** for `{your choice of users}`.

This can be a **new** social network, or the **re-design** of an existing one.

The more specific your **user target**, the more focused your UX design will be.

Examples of specific (good) user targets:

* a social network for `dog owners`
* a social network for `professional carers`
* a social network for `over-60 retired mothers`

Examples of broad (bad) user targets:

* a social network for `everyone`
* a social network for `students`
* a social network for `sports fans`
 
## Context

* Web-*sites* are turning into Web-*apps*: one does not simply *read* an app.
* The Web is being rebuilt around **people**, aka *the users* (think comments, recommendations, wishlists, personalised feeds..)
* **Social networks** are the most popular Web-apps for people to connect and interact with each other online
* A social Web-app is a gamble on **content** (will people **produce** content for your app?)
* The people use the **interfaces** (that you design) to do this
* You control the *user interface*, the *[blank slate](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/BlankSlate)* for new users, and the *content definition* (it's called *tweet*, not *share*, *post*, *update* etc.)
* Interfaces influence **behaviour**, and words influence **relationships** (*friends*, *partners*, *buddies*, *colleagues* etc.)
* The words you put on something, be it an **action** or a relationship, define your app.

# Learning goals

Upon completion of this unit you will (hopefully) be able to: 

* Understand the difference between qualitative and quantitative **user research**, and be familiar with a few techniques to perform both types of research.
 
* Research and analyse **competitor services** to gain inspiration and insight from them.

* Identify and use **design patterns** effectively in your projects.

* Produce user **personas**, user **stories** and user **journeys** to communicate and validate your design decisions.

* Understand the importance of motivational **copy-writing** in interface design, and write interface copy that is appropriate for your audience and their task(s) at hand.

* Use **paper-prototyping** and **wireframing** techniques to visualise your interface design ideas and explore alternative solutions.

* Use **rapid prototyping** tools to quickly test solutions to specific UX problems.

* Understand the differences between various **user-testing** methods (face2face, A/B testing and analytics) and practice them at a basic level
 
* Understand how to improve the findability of a product online, using basic **SEO** (search engine optimisation) techniques and tools.

* **Document** your design and development process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including *successes* and *failures*.
