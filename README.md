### During this course you will learn how to *research* the circumstances and needs of different types of *users*, to *design* and *prototype* interactive products that are both *usable* and *useful*.

In particular, you will get familiar with:

* **User eXperience** (UX) design principles and patterns  
* Qualitative and quantitative **user research** 
* **Competitor analysis**
* User **personas**, user **stories** and user **journey maps**
* **Interface design**: **paper-prototyping** and **wireframing**
* **Rapid prototyping** tools
* **User-testing**: face2face, A/B testing and analytics
* Motivational **copy-writing** for stickiness

### What this course is NOT

1. This course is **NOT about honing your coding skills**.   

	Whilst you are welcome to **prototype** your ideas using HTML+CSS+JS, there are many tools that will get you to similar results without touching code (or very little of it).

* This course is **not about Photoshop or Illustrator wizardry**.   

	You will be introduced to several tools that enable you to **wireframe** and **prototype** user interfaces quickly and effectively.  
  
	![](sessions/assets/photoshop.png)

* In this course **[Lorem ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) is banned**. 

	If a Web product aims to **deliver valuable content and facilitate meaningful interactions**, we should be designing **content-first** for the best possible UX. 
	
	*Lorem ipsum* is gibberish that conveniently fills the available space like an expanding gas. It is inert, meaningless and lacks context, revealing nothing about the relationship between your design and your content.   
  
	Using *Lorem ipsum* is a missed opportunity to do good UX design.

# Projects

### NMMaps

On this **team project** you will learn the methods and tools of *user research* and *iterative design*, by working on a real-world project for the National Maritime Museum (NMM) in Greenwich. 

All the project material is [here](projects/nmmaps).

### Filter bubbles (working title)

This **individual project** is about curating content generated by others, to produce an experience that makes users aware of their filter bubbles and/or invites them to burst them.

<!-- All the project material is [here](projects/dax). -->


# Learning goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Understand the difference between *qualitative* and *quantitative* **user research** and be familiar with a few techniques to perform both types of research.
* Research and analyse **competitor services** to gain inspiration and insight from them.
* Identify and use **design patterns** effectively in your projects.
* Produce user **personas**, user **stories** and user **journey maps** to communicate and validate your design decisions.
* Understand the importance of motivational **copy-writing** in interface design, and write interface copy that is appropriate for your audience and their task(s) at hand.
* Use **paper-prototyping** and **wireframing** techniques to visualise your interface design ideas and explore alternative solutions.
* Use **rapid prototyping** tools to quickly test solutions to specific UX problems.
* Understand the differences between various **user-testing** methods and practice them at a basic level.
* **Document** your design and development process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including *successes* and *failures*.
* **Communicate** your ideas both technically and in an engaging way.


# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late (even by 5 minutes) or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts. We'll deduct 2% from your grade for each uncommunicated tardiness or absence (aka the *2% Tardiness Tax*).

* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.

* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).

* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.

* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
