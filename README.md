### During this course you will learn how to effectively address the needs and circumstances of **Web users**, to design and prototype Web products that are comfortable and even joyful to use.

In particular, you will get familiar with:

* **User eXperience** (UX) design principles and patterns  
* Qualitative and quantitative **user research** 
* **Competitor analysis**
* User **personas*** , user **stories***  and user **journeys**
* **Interface design**: **paper-prototyping** and **wireframing**
* **Rapid prototyping** tools
* **User-testing**: face2face, A/B testing and analytics
* Motivational **copy-writing** for stickiness

### What this course is NOT

1. This course is **NOT about honing your coding skills**.   

	Whilst you are welcome to **prototype** your ideas using HTML+CSS+JS, there are many tools that will get you to similar results without touching code (or very little of it).

* This course is **not about Photoshop or Illustrator wizardry**.   

	You will be introduced to several tools that enable you to **wireframe** and **prototype** user interfaces quickly and effectively.  
  
	![](sessions/assets/photoshop.png)

* In this course **[Lorem ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) is banned**. 

	If a Web product aims to **deliver valuable content and facilitate meaningful interactions**, we should be designing **content-first** for the best possible UX. 
	
	*Lorem ipsum* is gibberish that conveniently fills the available space like an expanding gas. It is inert, meaningless and lacks context, revealing nothing about the relationship between your design and your content.   
  
	Using *Lorem ipsum* is a missed opportunity to do good UX design.

# Projects

### Kidesign <sup>Spring term</sup>

On this **team project** you will learn the methods and tools of *user research* and *iterative design*, by engaging with a challenging user group: primary school children and (their) parents. 

All the project material is [here](projects/kidesign).

### Art experience <sup>Summer term</sup>

Design and prototype a digital archive experience.

<!-- All the project material is [here](projects/art-experience). -->

# Assessment criteria

Your final grade will be based on:

* [75% project](#project)
* [25% blog](#blog)


## Project


### Components

1. **Research** identifying problems and opportunities through [competitor analysis](sessions/session-02.md#competitor-analysis), examining audiences through [user interviews](sessions/session-03.md#user-interviews), understanding [behaviours](sessions/session-14.md#designing-behaviours) and interpreting your research data through [user personas](sessions/session-04.md#user-personas) 
* **Experimentation** exploring ideas through [wireframes](sessions/session-05.md#wireframing) and [user journeys](sessions/session-06.md#user-journeys), from paper to digital
* **Iteration** [prototyping](sessions/session-13.md#rapid-prototyping) and [user-testing](sessions/session-15.md#user-testing-preparation) your concepts (both [remotely](sessions/session-07.md#usability-testing) and [face2face](sessions/session-15.md#let-them-in-))
* **Communication** writing [motivational copy](sessions/session-10.md#your-turn) for [emails](sessions/session-11.md#engagement-email) and [Web interfaces](sessions/session-10.md#2-hack-your-interface-copy), formalising your project requirements through [user stories](sessions/session-13.md#your-stories), presenting both your project's output and process  


### Grades

#### F

[M.I.A.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action) We saw you around but you failed to show evidence of your work. 

#### E

* **Research** either your competitor analysis, user interviews or user personas are missing, or they are disconnected and disorganised 
* **Experimentation** you wireframed only a handful of screens using filler content (*Lorem ipsum*, no images); your user journeys are superficial and/or delusional (wishful, not based on research evidence) 
* **Iteration** your prototypes are hard to test and therefore your user-testing didn't provide useful insight; your process was erratic
* **Communication** your presentation(s) lacked clarity and completeness

#### D

* **Research** you dipped your toes into competitor analysis, user interviews and user personas but they are disconnected 
* **Experimentation** you wireframed a handful of screens using real(istic) content; your user journeys are based on research evidence but shallow (happy ending, no explanations) 
* **Iteration** you prototyped and user-tested one concept, however you haven't addressed the road bumps your users encountered (one iteration only)
* **Communication** your presentation(s) were complete

#### C

* **Research** whilst your competitor analysis, user interviews and user personas are decent, they could integrate better into your process 
* **Experimentation** you wireframed key screens using real(istic) content; your user journeys are based on research evidence and explore a few scenarios 
* **Iteration** you prototyped and user-tested a few concepts, tested them with several users and folded their feedback into your design process (at least two iterations)
* **Communication** your presentation(s) were clear and complete

#### B

* **Research** whilst your competitor analysis and user interviews are broad and integrated, they could be better documented; your user personas are good and varied (we don't need 7 photocopies of young professionals with disposable income and thirst for technology) 
* **Experimentation** you wireframed key screens using real(istic) content, and your user journeys explore several scenarios in depth; you explained how your design decisions are linked to research evidence
* **Iteration** you prototyped and user-tested several  concepts, tested them with users and folded their feedback into your design process; more than two iterations
* **Communication** your presentation(s) were clear, complete and engaging

#### A

* **Research** your competitor analysis is thorough, your user interviews insightful and well documented, your user personas go deeper and are varied. Your research provides a solid foundation for your design
* **Experimentation** you wireframed key screens using real(istic) content, experimenting with UI design patterns and explaining how your design decisions are linked to research evidence; your user journeys are based on research evidence, highlight pain points and offer branching solutions
* **Iteration** you prototyped and user-tested various  concepts, testing them both on a high level and refining the details (eg A/B testing); more than two iterations
* **Communication** your presentation(s) were clear, complete, engaging and original

# Learning goals

* Understand the difference between *qualitative* and *quantitative* **user research** and be familiar with a few techniques to perform both types of research.
 
* Research and analyse **competitor services** to gain inspiration and insight from them.

* Identify and use **design patterns** effectively in your projects.

* Produce user **personas**, user **stories** and user **journeys** to communicate and validate your design decisions.

* Understand the importance of motivational **copy-writing** in interface design, and write interface copy that is appropriate for your audience and their task(s) at hand.

* Use **paper-prototyping** and **wireframing** techniques to visualise your interface design ideas and explore alternative solutions.

* Use **rapid prototyping** tools to quickly test solutions to specific UX problems.

* Understand the differences between various **user-testing** methods and practice them at a basic level.

* **Document** your design and development process, from the exploration of ideas to their practical implementation. Including *successes* and *failures*.

* **Communicate** your ideas both technically and in an engaging way.

* Use the Git version-control system (through GitHub) to **collaborate** with your team and **back-up** your project files.


# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late (even by 5 minutes) or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts. We'll deduct 2% from your grade for each uncommunicated tardiness or absence (aka the *2% Tardiness Tax*).

* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.

* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).

* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.

* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
