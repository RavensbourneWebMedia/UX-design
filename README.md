# Designing the UX

<!-- ## [bit.ly/WEB14204](http://bit.ly/WEB14204) -->

This unit introduces you to the methods and tools used to effectively address the needs and circumstances of Web users, to design and produce Web interfaces that are comfortable and even joyful to use.

This includes:

* qualitative and quantitative **user research** 
* **competitor analysis**
* **User eXperience** (UX) design principles and patterns
* user **personas**, user **stories** and user **journeys**
* **interface design**: **paper-prototyping** and **wireframing**
* **rapid prototyping** tools
* **user-testing**: face2face, A/B testing and analytics
* motivational **copy-writing** for stickiness

### What this unit is NOT

1. This unit is **not about honing your coding skills**.   

	Whilst you are welcome to **prototype** your ideas using HTML+CSS+JS, there are many tools that will get you to similar end-results without touching code (or very little of it).

* This unit is **not about Photoshop or Illustrator wizardry**.   

	You will be introduced to several tools that enable you to **wireframe** and **prototype** user interfaces quickly and effectively.

* In this unit **[Lorem ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) is banned**. 

	If a Web product aims to **deliver valuable content and facilitate meaningful interactions**, we should be designing **content-first** for the best possible UX. 
	
	*Lorem ipsum* is gibberish that conveniently fills the available space like an expanding gas. It is inert, meaningless and lacks context, revealing nothing about the relationship between your design and your content.   
  
	Using *Lorem ipsum* is a missed opportunity to do good UX design.

# Brief

Design the **UX** and build the **prototype** of a Web-based **social network** for `{your choice of users}`.

This can be a **new** social network, or the **re-design** of an existing one.

The more specific your **user target**, the more focused your UX design will be.

Examples of specific (good) user targets:

* a social network for `dog owners`
* a social network for `professional carers`
* a social network for `over-60 retired mothers`

Examples of broad (bad) user targets:

* a social network for `everyone`
* a social network for `students`
* a social network for `sports fans`
 
### Context

<!-- from https://speakerdeck.com/destraynor/the-language-of-interfaces -->

* Web-*sites* are turning into Web-*apps*: one does not simply *read* an app.
* The Web is being rebuilt around **people**, aka *the users* (think comments, recommendations, wish lists, personalised feeds..)
* **Social networks** are the most popular Web-apps for people to connect and interact with each other online
* A social Web-app is a gamble on **content** (will people **produce** content for your app?)
* The people use the **interfaces** (that you design) to do this
* You control the *user interface*, the *[blank slate](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/BlankSlate)* for new users, and the *content definition* (it's called *tweet*, not *share*, *post*, *update* etc.)
* Interfaces influence **behaviour**, and words influence **relationships** (*friends*, *partners*, *buddies*, *colleagues* etc.)
* The words you put on something, be it an **action** or a relationship, define your app.

# Assessment criteria

Your final grade will be based on:

* [75% project](#project)
* [25% blog](#blog)


## Project


### Components

1. **Research** identifying problems and opportunities through [competitor analysis](sessions/session-02.md#competitor-analysis), examining audiences through [user interviews](sessions/session-03.md#user-interviews), understanding [behaviours](sessions/session-14.md#designing-behaviours) and interpreting your research data through [user personas](sessions/session-04.md#user-personas) 
* **Experimentation** exploring ideas through [wireframes](sessions/session-05.md#wireframing) and [user journeys](sessions/session-06.md#user-journeys), from paper to digital
* **Iteration** [prototyping](sessions/session-13.md#rapid-prototyping) and [user-testing](sessions/session-15.md#user-testing-preparation) your concepts (both [remotely](sessions/session-07.md#usability-testing) and [face2face](sessions/session-15.md#let-them-in-))
* **Communication** writing [motivational copy](sessions/session-10.md#your-turn) for [emails](sessions/session-11.md#engagement-email) and [Web interfaces](sessions/session-10.md#2-hack-your-interface-copy), formalising your project requirements through [user stories](sessions/session-13.md#your-stories), presenting both your project's output and process  


### Grades

#### F

[M.I.A.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action) We saw you around but you failed to show evidence of your work. 

#### E

* **Research** either your competitor analysis, user interviews or user personas are missing, or they are disconnected and disorganised 
* **Experimentation** you wireframed only a handful of screens using filler content (*Lorem ipsum*, no images); your user journeys are superficial and/or delusional (wishful, not based on research evidence) 
* **Iteration** your prototypes are hard to test and therefore your user-testing didn't provide useful insight; your process was erratic
* **Communication** your presentation(s) lacked clarity and completeness
<!-- not just bout presentations-->

#### D

* **Research** you dipped your toes into competitor analysis, user interviews and user personas but they are disconnected 
* **Experimentation** you wireframed a handful of screens using real(istic) content; your user journeys are based on research evidence but shallow (happy ending, no explanations) 
* **Iteration** you prototyped and user-tested one concept, however you haven't addressed the road bumps your users encountered (one iteration only)
* **Communication** your presentation(s) were complete
<!-- not just bout presentations-->

#### C

* **Research** whilst your competitor analysis, user interviews and user personas are decent, they could integrate better into your process 
* **Experimentation** you wireframed key screens using real(istic) content; your user journeys are based on research evidence and explore a few scenarios 
* **Iteration** you prototyped and user-tested a few concepts, tested them with several users and folded their feedback into your design process (at least two iterations)
* **Communication** your presentation(s) were clear and complete
<!-- not just bout presentations-->

#### B

* **Research** whilst your competitor analysis and user interviews are broad and integrated, they could be better documented; your user personas are good and varied (we don't need 7 photocopies of young professionals with disposable income and thirst for technology) 
* **Experimentation** you wireframed key screens using real(istic) content, and your user journeys explore several scenarios in depth; you explained how your design decisions are linked to research evidence
* **Iteration** you prototyped and user-tested several  concepts, tested them with users and folded their feedback into your design process; more than two iterations
* **Communication** your presentation(s) were clear, complete and engaging
<!-- not just bout presentations-->

#### A

* **Research** your competitor analysis is thorough, your user interviews insightful and well documented, your user personas go deeper and are varied. Your research provides a solid foundation for your design
* **Experimentation** you wireframed key screens using real(istic) content, experimenting with UI design patterns and explaining how your design decisions are linked to research evidence; your user journeys are based on research evidence, highlight pain points and offer branching solutions
* **Iteration** you prototyped and user-tested various  concepts, testing them both on a high level and refining the details (eg A/B testing); more than two iterations
* **Communication** your presentation(s) were clear, complete, engaging and original
<!-- not just bout presentations-->
